<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />COMANCHES.</h2>
<p>It was now quite late in the afternoon, and Fred
Wainwright reined up his mustang, and from his position
took a survey of the surrounding prairie. On
his right stretched the broad dusty plain, broken by
some rough hills, and on his left wound the Gila,
while in the distance could be detected the faint blue
of the Maggolien Mountains.</p>
<p>But it was little heed he paid to the natural beauties
of the scene, for an uncomfortable fear had taken
possession of him during the last hour. Once or
twice he was sure he had detected, off towards the
mountains signs of Comanche Indians, and he was
well satisfied that if such were the case they had assuredly
seen him, and just now he was speculating
upon the best line of retreat if such were the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are off there, and set their eyes on me,&rdquo;
he speculated, &ldquo;the only chance for me is towards the
Gila, and what can I do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might well ask the question, for it was one
which would probably require a speedy answer. The
Comanches, as are well known, are among the most
daring riders and bravest red men on the American
Continent, and when they take it into their heads to
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
follow up an enemy, one of three things is certain&mdash;his
destruction, a desperate fight or a skilful escape.</p>
<p>The young hunter had no desire to encounter these
specimens of aboriginal cavalry, for he was certain in
the first place that there were half a dozen of them,
and that it would be madness to stand his ground,
while his chances of eluding them were exceedingly
dubious. Although mounted on a fine mustang,
there was little doubt but what the Indians were
equally well mounted, and he had little prospect of
success in a trial of speed.</p>
<p>There was only one thing in his favor, and that was
that night was close at hand. He was somewhat in
the situation of the mariner when pursued by the
pirate, who sees his only hope of life in the friendly
darkness which is closing around. The young hunter
looked at the low descending sun, and wondered what
kept it so long above the horizon, and then he scanned
every portion of the sky, to see whether no clouds
were gathering in masses, which would increase the
intensity of the darkness. But the sky was clear,
although he remembered that there was no moon, and
when night should fairly come it would be one of
Egyptian gloom, which would give him all the shelter
he wished.</p>
<p>At the precise point where the young hunter was
journeying was a mass of tall grass, which partially
concealed himself and horse, and which, as a natural
consequence, he was reluctant to leave so long as he
was sure that danger threatened him. His little mustang
advanced slowly, his rider holding a tight rein
and glancing toward the river, and then toward the
hills on the right, from which he expected each moment
to see the screeching Comanches emerge and
thunder down toward him.</p>
<p>But as the sun dipped below the horizon the young
hunter began to take heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they give me an hour longer, I think my
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
chances will be good,&rdquo; he muttered, growing more
anxious each moment.</p>
<p>At one point in the hills he noticed a broken place,
a sort of pass, from which he seemed to feel a premonition
that the Indians would sally forth to make their
attack; so before coming opposite he reined up, determined
to proceed no further until it was dark
enough to be safe.</p>
<p>He had sat in this position a half an hour or so, and
the gloom was already settling over the prairie, when
a succession of terrific yells struck upon his ear, and
glancing toward the hills, he saw half a dozen Comanches
thundering down toward him. The hunter
at once threw himself off his horse, and resting his
rifle on his back, sighted at the approaching redskins.
They were nigh enough to be in range, and satisfied
that they could be intimidated in no other way, he
took a quick aim and fired.</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright possessed an extraordinary skill
in the use of the rifle, and the shriek and the frantic
flinging up of the arms, and the headlong stumble
from his horse of the leading Comanche, showed that
the fright of his situation had not rendered his nerves
unsteady.</p>
<p>This decided action had the effect of checking the
tumultuous advance for a few moments; but the
hunter had been in the South-West long enough to
understand the nature of these Comanches, and he
knew they would soon be after him again. Springing
on his horse therefore, he wheeled about without
a moment&rsquo;s delay, and started at full speed on his back
track.</p>
<p>Wainwright soon made the gratifying discovery
that the speed of his own mustang was equal to that
of the animals bestrode by the Comanches, and that
even for a time he steadily drew away from them.
But his own horse was jaded with half a day&rsquo;s tramp,
and could maintain this tremendous gait for comparatively
a short period, while those of the Indians were
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
fresh and vigorous and could not fail soon to draw
nigh him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, if the fellow keeps this up for a half
hour longer, we shall care nothing for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little animal strained every nerve, and worked
as if he knew the fate of himself and master was depending
upon his efforts. The young hunter glanced
over his shoulder and could just discern his followers
through the gloom, they still shouting and yelling
like madmen, as if they sought to paralyze him
through great terror. He loaded his gun as he rode,
and several times was on the point of turning and exchanging
shots with them; but he did not forget there
were two parties to the business, and that their return
shots might either kill or wound himself or mustang,
the ultimate result in each case being the same. So
he gave his whole attention to getting over the prairie
as fast as possible.</p>
<p>About fifteen minutes had elapsed when the crack
of a rifle rung out upon the air, and the bullet whistled
within a few feet of the head of the fugitive. He
again looked back and could see nothing of his pursuers.
At this juncture he struck in among some
tall grass similar to that in which he halted when he
first beheld the Comanches; and at the same instant
he saw that his beast was rapidly giving out.</p>
<p>He hated to part with him but it could not be
helped. Delay would be fatal, and reining his horse
down to a moderate canter, he sprang to the earth
and gave him a blow, which sent him with renewed
speed on his way.</p>
<p>Then running rapidly a few rods the hunter dropped
flat on his face and listened. All the time he
heard the thundering of the approaching horsemen,
but he did not dare to raise his head to look. They
came nearer and nearer, and the next moment had
passed by and for the present he was safe.</p>
<p>Not doubting but that they would speedily come
up with the fleeing mustang and discover the ruse
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
played upon them, Wainwright arose to his feet and
made all haste toward the Gila.</p>
<p>By this time it was very dark and he was guided
only by a general knowledge of the direction in which
it lay, and by the sound of its gentle flowing. Once
along its steep banks he felt sure of being able to conceal
himself, and, if needful, of throwing his enemies
off his trail entirely, should they attempt pursuit, when
it again became light.</p>
<p>Hurrying thus carelessly forward he committed a
natural blunder but one which made him ashamed of
himself. He walked straight off the bank a dozen
feet high, dropping within a yard of a small camp
fire, around which were seated two trappers smoking
their pipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, stranger, did you drop from the clouds?&rdquo;
asked one of them, merely turning his head without
changing his position. The other turned his eyes
slightly but did nothing more. &ldquo;This &rsquo;yer what I
call a new style of introducing yourself into gentlemen&rsquo;s
society; shoot me for a beaver if it aint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it is,&rdquo; laughed Wainwright, &ldquo;but you see I
was in quite a hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you in such a hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was fleeing from Indians&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded both of them in a
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was fleeing from Indians, and was looking more
behind than in front of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That yer&rsquo;s what I call a different story,&rdquo; exclaimed
the oldest, springing up and dashing the burning
embers apart, so as to extinguish the light as soon
as possible. It required but a few moments thoroughly
to complete the work, when he turned to Wainwright
and asked in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mought they be close at hand, stranger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you time to talk a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then just squat yourself on the ground and tell
us all about this scrape you &rsquo;pear to have got yourself
into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero did as requested, giving a succinct account
of what we have told the reader, beginning the
narration at precisely the same point in which we did,
and carrying it up to his &ldquo;stepping off&rdquo; the bank.
The two trappers listened respectfully until he was
done, when one of them gave an expressive grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;'Younker, you don&rsquo;t look as if you had two faces,
and I make no doubt you&rsquo;ve told us the truth; but
it was qua&rsquo;r you should happen to be trampin&rsquo; alone
so far away from the settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was with a party of hunters this morning, but
became separated from them and was on my return to
the camp when I was shut off in the manner I have
told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to get back to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I aint particular,&rdquo; laughed the young hunter,
with a peculiar expression. &ldquo;It aint likely they have
waited an hour for me when they discovered my absence,
and so I should be at a loss to know where to
look for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s all the same to us,&rdquo; said the trapper;
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t look like a scamp, and you can stay with
us, if you want to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, furthermore, that I have lost my horse,
and shall have to take it afoot until I can buy or capture
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can fix that up easy enough,&rdquo; grunted the
trapper. &ldquo;My hoss Blue Blazes can carry all that can
get on his back, and we can give you a lift till you
can scare up an animile of some kind or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain that the trappers were really kind at
heart, and were anxious to give the young hunter a
&ldquo;lift.&rdquo; They were rough in their manner and speech
but the diamond is frequently forbidding in its appearance
until it is polished, and the wonderful gem
displayed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>While this trapper was conversing with the stranger,
his companion had stealthily made his way down
the bank some distance, where he had clambered up
on the plain, and made a reconnoissance to assure
himself that the &ldquo;coast was clear.&rdquo; Discovering nothing
suspicious, he had turned back again and speedily
rejoined the other two.</p>
<p>The fire having completely gone out they were left
in entire darkness sitting together on the bank of the
Gila.</p>
<p>One of the trappers was short, muscular, with a
compact frame, resembling in physique the renowned
Kit Carson. His name was George Harling, and he
hailed from Missouri, and was a hunter and trapper
of a dozen years experience. He was generally mild,
quick and genial tempered, but when in the Comanche
fight, or when on the trail of some of the daring
marauders of the northern tribes, he was a perfect
terror, fearless, dashing and heedless of all danger.</p>
<p>The second hunter who hitherto had maintained
the principal part of the conversation with Wainwright
was a tall, lank, bony individual, restless in
manner and sometimes impulsive in speech, was
called Ward Lancaster, and seemed to have tramped
in every part of the country west of the Mississippi;
for you could not mention a tribe of Indians, or a peculiar
locality, but what he had been there, and had
something interesting to tell about it.</p>
<p>He was about fifty years of age, with not a gray
hair in his head, and with as gleaming an eye as he
possessed thirty years before, when he first placed his
foot on the western bank of the Father of Waters,
and slinging his rifle over his shoulder, plunged into
the vast wilderness, an eager sharer in the adventures
and dangers that awaited him.</p>
<p>Ward was a pleasant, even tempered individual,
who, when led into the ambush, and fighting desperately
the dusky demons who were swarming around
him, did so as cooly and cautiously as he galloped
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
over the billowy prairie. He was one of those individuals
who seemed born to act as guide and director
for parties traversing those regions, where it seems to
a man of ordinary ability, fully a lifetime would be
required to gain a comparatively slight knowledge.
His instinct was never known to be at fault. When
in the midst of the immense arid plains, which stretched
away on every hand, until like the ocean it joined
the sky; in the centre of these vast tracts, with man
and beast famishing for water, and when no one else
could see the clue, by which to escape from the dreadful
situation, Ward displayed a knowledge or intuition,
which to say the least, was extraordinary. Looking
up to the brassy sky, and then away to the distant
horizon, and then at the parched ground, he
would fall into a deep reverie, which would last for a
few moments, at the end of which he would start off
at a rapid gallop toward some invisible point, and the
end of that ride was&mdash;&mdash;water.</p>
<p>When questioned as to the manner by which he acquired
this remarkable skill, the trapper never gave a
satisfactory answer. He sometimes said it must be
that he scented the water; but, as it is well known
that this element has no smell, taste or color, although
the presence of vegetation, which it causes, and which
is nearly always a sign of it, frequently gives out a
strong odor, which guides the thirsty animal from a
long distance, yet it cannot be supposed for an instant
that the hunter acquired his wonderful knowledge
in this manner. No human olfactories have ever
been known to hold a hundredth part of the delicacy
necessary for such an exploit. Ward always smiled
rather significantly when he gave such an answer.</p>
<p>It might be that he was really ignorant of the means
by which he possessed such a superiority over his fellow
creatures in this respect, and which made them
only too glad to follow him to any point he indicated,
without fear of consequences; or it may be that he
had acquired some subtle secret of the &ldquo;hidden
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
springs&rdquo; of nature&mdash;some knowledge of her means of
working&mdash;so hidden from human knowledge that they
can be reached by no process of reasoning, and are
only discovered (which is rarely the case,) by accident.</p>
<p>Such a knowledge, or &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; as it is properly termed,
is frequently found among the North American
Indians&mdash;a people whose inability to grasp the simplest
truths of art or science, is too well known to
need reference here. Some withered old Medicine
man, or wrinkled old woman, with her crooning and
sorcery, is frequently the depository of a secret in
medicines,&mdash;of the subtle working in certain forms of
disease, of some apparently harmless plant, which
when made known to the prying eyes of his pale
faced brother, has made his fame and reputation and
has given him a name for learning and skill, that has
made him the enemy of the whole profession.</p>
<p>How many of the colossal fortunes of the present
day have been builded upon the knowledge of some
Medicine Man, or some negro woman who has gained
a well founded reputation among the ignorant people.</p>
<p>So we say Ward Lancaster may have stumbled upon
some secret of nature&rsquo;s workings, which the jealous
dame had carefully veiled from other eyes; and in
the presence of this knowledge he never went astray.</p>
<p>The hunter was full of adventures, and could recount
his experience by the hour as he sat smoking
around the camp fire, at the end of the chase, or at the
close of the day&rsquo;s tramp. He had acted as guide to
several expeditions which had crossed the Rocky
Mountains into California and Oregon; and, at the
present time, he and Harling were looking for a caravan
or large emigrant party, which they had been
sent from Santa Fe to intercept and guide into Lower
California.</p>
<p>Having thus introduced somewhat at length our
friends to our readers, we come to speak more particularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
of their first meeting. They soon explained
each other&rsquo;s name and destination to each other, when
Ward seemed disposed to question Wainwright still
further. He thought he saw about the young man
signs indicating that he had followed this hunting
and trapping business but a comparatively short time.
His well shaped hands, had not the brown, hardy
character which characterized those of his companions,
and the jetty luxuriant beard failed to conceal
the rosy-tinted skin, which could never have been retained
under the storm and tempest of the prairie.</p>
<p>Wainwright, however, skilfully parried the questions
when they came too close, or refused to answer
them altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong further east,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there are
some things which I don&rsquo;t choose to tell at present.
The time may come when I shall be glad to do so,
but it hasn&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; that yer is what I call a hint to keep
my mouth shet. Howsomever, you&rsquo;ll allow me to
ask another question or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, you may <i>ask</i> all you please,&rdquo; replied
the young hunter, with a significant intonation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been on the prairies, and
among the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little over a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been with one party of hunters all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; with half a dozen, and once with a party of
Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you learned any thing of the ways of the
mountains and prairies in that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I expect to be associated with you for some
time, I will waive that question for a few months, and
then allow you to answer it for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sensible,&rdquo; grunted Harling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only one
more question to ax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought you out here? A quarrel, love
adventure, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;If any one asks you such a question tell him you
are unable to answer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a decided reply, and the trapper so accepted
it. They had conversed together in low tones,
occasionally pausing and listening for any sound of
their enemies, but they heard none&mdash;nothing breaking
the stillness but the solemn flow of the dark
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Harling, &ldquo;we had better move our
quarters, for these sneaking Comanches can smell a
white man, about as far as you can smell water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what I was a thinkin&rsquo; on,&rdquo; muttered his
companion, &ldquo;Mo when-your-right, or Wainwright,
you&rsquo;ll foller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three began stealing along the bank of the
river, frequently pausing and listening, but as yet,
hearing nothing suspicious. The sky had cleared
somewhat during the last hour, and the clouds which
had overspread it after the sun went down, and a
number of stars were visible. Still it was very
gloomy, the party being barely able to discern a few
feet in front of them, as they advanced so stealthily
upon their way.</p>
<p>Ward took the lead, his form being faintly visible,
as he carefully picked his way, while behind him came
Harling, and our hero, the young hunter, brought up
the rear. The latter had heard them speak of their
horses, and knew of course that they must be the
owners of animals, which were so indispensable in
this desolate country; but he wondered where they
were kept, as he failed to see anything of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I shall learn all in due time,&rdquo; was his
conclusion, as they walked leisurely along.</p>
<p>They had progressed in this manner perhaps for a
third of a mile, when the leader hastily scrambled up
the bank the others following, found themselves on
the edge of the prairie, which had witnessed the exciting
chase between the Comanches and the young
hunter, a few hours before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>By this time the sky had cleared and objects could
be seen quite distinctly, for a considerable distance.
The three men halted and looked out upon the prairie,
but saw nothing but darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your horses!&rdquo; inquired Wainwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a mile from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aint you afraid of losing them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much; they&rsquo;re lied where it would take a pair
of sharp eyes to find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those Comanches&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; interrupted the trapper, &ldquo;I hear something
walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened, and the faintest sounds of footfalls
could be heard, quite hesitatingly, as if some one were
very cautiously approaching them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down!&rdquo; whispered Ward, sinking silently to the
earth, &ldquo;whoever it is is coming this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were not slow in imitating his example,
and lying thus upon the ground intently listening,
they now and then caught a dull sound, as if made by
an Indian carrying a heavy body, with which he retreated,
as often as he advanced. A person who had
had no experience of prairie life would have failed to
hear the sound at all; but all three of our friends
heard it distinctly.</p>
<p>Ward Lancaster had detected the direction of the
sound, and was peering out on the prairie in the hope
of discerning the cause of it. All at once he gave
utterance to a suppressed exclamation, and then added,
as he turned his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I cannot tell,&rdquo; replied Wainwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a horse, and if I&rsquo;m not powerful mistaken it&rsquo;s
your own animal; but hold on; don&rsquo;t rise; it may
be a trick of the Comanches to find out where you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse steadily advanced until a few feet of the
prostrate men, when it pawed and snuffed the air
Ward then quietly arose, and before the animal could
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
wheel about, he seized the bridle and held it a prisoner.
Wainwright then came up and found that it was
his own mustang, with all his accoutrements complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fortunate!&rdquo; he exclaimed in pleased surprise,
as he examined the saddle and bridle; &ldquo;every
thing seems to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it proved, and Wainwright lost no time in putting
himself astride of his mustang. Following the
direction of his friends, they soon reached a small
clump of stunted trees and undergrowth, where the
trappers&rsquo; horses were found. It was at first proposed
that they should encamp here for the night, but, as
the Comanches were unquestionably in the vicinity,
they concluded to get as far away as possible. So
they mounted their animals, and under the leadership
of Ward took the river for their guide, and rode at a
moderate walk until daylight, by which time they had
placed many a long mile between themselves and their
dusky enemies.</p>
<p>The hunters scrutinized every suspicious point and
took a careful survey of the surrounding prairie and
hills, but discovered nothing suspicious, and they concluded
that there was nothing further to fear from
these wild riders of the plains.</p>
<p>The range of hills was still in sight, and offered a
secure hiding place for any of their enemies who
chose to conceal themselves there, but if such were the
case, the trappers were confident they could detect
them, and failing in this they believed themselves justified
in coming to the conclusion mentioned.</p>
<p>Ward took his bearings and headed towards a point
where he hoped to intercept the emigrant train; but
when night came they had not yet reached it, and they
encamped in a small grove. Wainwright had brought
down an antelope with his rifle, at such a distance as
to extort a compliment from the hunters, and thus
bountifully provided for supper, they counted upon a
pleasant evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />IN CAMP.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come, George, isn&rsquo;t that steak done yet?&rdquo; inquired
the impatient Lancaster. &ldquo;It strikes me that
it has just got the color to insure a good taste. What
do you think Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry enough to make anything taste good
to me, stewed, fried or raw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just keep easy,&rdquo; replied Harling. &ldquo;When
the meat is ready you shall have it&mdash;not before&mdash;no
matter how hungry you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woofh!&rdquo; exclaimed Lancaster, &ldquo;if I get much
hungrier, I&rsquo;ll eat the meat up and take you by way of
dessert. So hurry up, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not the least attention did the imperturbable cook
pay to the murmurings of those around. He turned
the meat around as slowly and carefully as ever, and
when it had reached the point when Lancaster declared
it was &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; he removed it from its perches, served
it into three equal slices, and announced that it was
ready.</p>
<p>So it proved&mdash;rich, steamy, juicy and tender, so
that it fairly melted in their mouths. No sooner did
it touch their palates, than they inwardly thanked the
cook for resisting their importunities, and furnishing
them with such a choice morsel. They thanked him
inwardly, we say, but, as might be expected, each
took particular good care to say nothing about it.</p>
<p>But Harling saw his advantage and followed it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a couple of purty pups, aint you? Don&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
know what&rsquo;s best for you. If it wasn&rsquo;t for me, you&rsquo;d
both starve to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; replied Lancaster, &ldquo;let other people
brag up your cooking; don&rsquo;t do it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one in this crowd got gratitude to
thank me after I&rsquo;ve crammed their mouths for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wouldn&rsquo;t do it myself,&rdquo; laughed Fred
Wainwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall too, for it deserves it, and it&rsquo;s time you
learned to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it,&rdquo; cried Lancaster, pretending to have
great difficulty in tearing the meat asunder; &ldquo;if this
piece hadn&rsquo;t been cooked so long, it would be fit for
a white man to eat, but as it is, it is enough to tear
my teeth out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re making such a pig of yourself. Try
and eat like a civilized being, and you&rsquo;ll find it tender
enough for an infant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you find it Fred?&rdquo; turning toward their
younger companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can manage to worry down a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you could!&rdquo; was the indignant
comment of the cook, as his friends swallowed the
last mouthful.</p>
<p>The darkness slowly settled over prairie and mountain,
and when the hunters had gorged themselves
with meat, so rich and juicy that they could not conceal
their delight, they wiped their greasy fingers upon
their heads, produced their pipes, lay back and &ldquo;enjoyed
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although in the midst of a hostile country, all three
were too experienced to feel any apprehension regarding
their safety. This fire had been so skilfully kindled
at the bottom of a hollow, so artfully, that a
lynx-eyed Apache or Comanche might have stood
within a hundred feet of them without suspecting its
existence. Their horses, too, had been trained long
enough in danger and peril to know the value of silence
on a dark night and in a still country; and there
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
was no fear of their discovery by hostile eyes through
any indiscretion on their part.</p>
<p>From long exposure to danger, the hunters had acquired
a habit of speaking in low tones, and frequently
pausing and listening before making responses to a
question. When they laughed, no matter how heartily,
it was without noise, except out upon the broad
prairie, when their cramped up lungs demanded freedom,
and then their laugh rang out clear and loud,
like the blast of a silver trumpet.</p>
<p>Even as they smoked, the coal in their pipes was invisible.
They had a fashion unknown to us of more
civilized regions, of sinking the coal or burning part
of the pipe below the surface of the tobacco, by a
few extra long whiffs, so that, as they leisurely drew
upon them afterwards there was no fear of the red
points betraying their presence, a thing which has
more than once taken place in the early history of our
country.</p>
<p>The party drew at their pipes in quiet enjoyment
for some time, and then, as the night was pleasant and
warm they fell into an easy conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether we shall come upon the caravan
tomorrow,&rdquo; remarked Fred Wainwright, not because
he imagined there was any thing particularly brilliant
in the remark, but for the same reason that we frequently
say a pointless thing&mdash;because we can&rsquo;t think of
something better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps we shall, and p&rsquo;raps we shant,&rdquo; was the
non-committal answer of Ward Lancaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right for once,&rdquo; said Harling. &ldquo;No
matter whether we see &rsquo;em or not there isn&rsquo;t much
danger of you prophesying wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I really think we are somewhere in their vicinity
and we shall see something of them tomorrow&mdash;some
sign at least that will give us an idea of their
whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure this emigrant train is where it can
be found?&rdquo; asked Fred Wainwright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>sir</i>. I said that; I understand it, which is a
blamed sight more than either of you two lunkheads
could do. The fellow was in earnest about it. Didn&rsquo;t
you see Harling how quick the feller came straight at
me, and talked to me like a man whose life depended
on his getting my service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go far enough to offer a price?&rdquo; inquired
Harling, rather quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>sir</i>,&rdquo; was the triumphant reply. &ldquo;He hauled
out several yellow boys, and wanted to put them in
my hands to seal the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took &rsquo;em, of course?&rdquo; remarked Fred in a
serious tone, but taking advantage of the darkness to
grin to an alarming extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No <span class="sc">SIR</span>!&rdquo; was the indignant response. &ldquo;I told
&rsquo;em I took money after I&rsquo;d done a thing&mdash;not before.
He seemed quite anxious and urged me to take it saying
it was a-ahem-a-rainen-strainer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retainer,&rdquo; accented Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; something like that; don&rsquo;t know what it
means, but I told him I did not do business in that
way. I axed him all about the company and learned
all I wanted, and then told him when it reached &lsquo;Old
Man&rsquo;s Point,&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be thar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How near are we to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten miles off; we&rsquo;ll ride there before breakfast
tomorrow, and take our first meal with the
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of their guide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guide was shot by an Apache Indian two
days ago, and the party have been half frightened to
death ever since. They declared, if they could not
find a guide, they would never enter California; as
you can see we&rsquo;ve good reason to &rsquo;spect they&rsquo;ll be <i>rather</i>
glad to have our company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems singular that the very man upon whom
they relied, and the one who no doubt knew more
about the Indians than all the others combined, should
be the very first one to fall a victim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know he was the first one?&rdquo; demanded
Ward Lancaster, almost fiercely, as he turned
his face toward Fred Wainwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it; only imagined it from the remark
you made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps he was the first one,&rdquo; was the complacent
remark of the hunter, as he resumed his pipe.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know neither to the contrary notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s my opinion you&rsquo;d better keep your mouth
shet,&rdquo; was the comment of Harling. &ldquo;Them people
that don&rsquo;t know nothing, gain the most credit by saying
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason you keep mum so much of the
time, I &rsquo;spose. Wal, that&rsquo;s right; you ought to
know yourself; don&rsquo;t let me change your habits, because
that is a mighty good habit you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me it would be a good habit for us all to
follow at this time,&rdquo; suggested Fred Wainwright.
&ldquo;It is getting late, and I feel like going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead then,&rdquo; said Ward.</p>
<p>But the hour was growing late, and shortly after
the three hunters were wrapped in profound slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />THE COMANCHES AND THEIR PRIZE.</h2>
<p>The gray dawn of early morning was just beginning
to break over the prairie when the &ldquo;Trappers of
the Gila&rdquo; were active. Such men are invariably early
risers, unless they have been deprived of several
night&rsquo;s rest, and desire to make it entirely up at one
stretch.</p>
<p>Harling&rsquo;s culinary skill had given him the position
of caterer to the company&rsquo;s appetite, and from what
has been mentioned in the preceding chapter, there
will be but little doubt but that he had succeeded admirably.</p>
<p>The time to which we refer being quite modern,
the party always went provided with lucifer matches,
instead of resorting to the use of the tedious flint and
tender. Of course they were easily carried in such a
manner as to be impervious to damp, and to be reliable
at all times.</p>
<p>Abundant fuel was close at hand, and not five minutes
intervened after their rising, when a bright fire
was crackling and snapping, and the cook had another
goodly-sized piece of antelope steaming and sizzling,
giving out an odor enough to drive a hungry man distracted.
A clear icy cold stream a hundred yards
away, afforded them the means of performing their
morning ablutions.</p>
<p>The breakfast was hastily swallowed, and just as the
first beams of the morning sun came up the eastern
horizon, the three hunters, mounted on their animals,
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
were galloping over the prairie, toward Old Man&rsquo;s
Point, quite a noted place, which could be distinguished
on the plains for a distance of twenty miles.</p>
<p>At the very moment of starting, Lancaster looked to
the north, where a dark point, apparently the size of a
man&rsquo;s body could be distinguished. This he announced
was the point of rendezvous, so well known to parties
crossing the plain and passing into Lower California.
As it was in plain sight, all the party had to do was
to ride straight toward it.</p>
<p>The hunters were galloping in this leisurely manner,
when Fred Wainwright suddenly exclaimed with no
little excitement,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder come the emigrants this very minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he pointed away to the east, where in
the distance could be seen a cloud of smoke, as if
made by the trampling of animals. Nothing else
could be distinguished, but a moment&rsquo;s glance sufficed
to show unmistakably that it was not natural clouds,
such as an inexperienced eye would pronounce it, but
it was the fine dry powder of the parched prairie
raised by the passage of multitudinous feet.</p>
<p>From the distance and through the haze nothing at
all could be discovered of those who were &ldquo;kicking
up the dust.&rdquo; The fact that it was very near that
quarter from which they expected the coming of the
emigrant party, and that it was at the very time they
were looking for their coming, argued strongly for
their being their friends. But neither Harling nor
Lancaster were quite satisfied on this point.</p>
<p>Reining their horses down to a slow walk, they
gazed long and fixedly in the direction of the tumult,
and finally the sharp-scented trapper exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t white men; they&rsquo;re Injins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; inquired Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can smell &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, however, was an attempt to be facetious, and
the hunter condescended to give his reasons for holding
such strong suspicions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see there is too much dust, in the first place,
for a party of white folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the prairie looks as if it hadn&rsquo;t rained
for six months, and we have left a trail behind us,
something like a Mississippi steamer leaves, when she
throws every thing she has on board into her furnaces,
for the sake of beating her rival. Just look behind
you and see what a cloud you have left in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know,&rdquo; returned Lancaster, without turning
his head. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just the reason for them
&rsquo;ere thieves off yonder being redskins. We&rsquo;ve had
our horses in a gallop, and their hoofs have kicked up
this dust, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s just what has been done over yonder.
You have heard, I suppose, that emigrant parties
aint apt to go &rsquo;cross the plains on a full canter,
you&rsquo;ve larn&rsquo;t that I &rsquo;spose, haint you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt it now if I didn&rsquo;t know it before,&rdquo;
laughed Fred. &ldquo;You know there may rise occasions
for them to put themselves at their highest speed, as
when a party of Indians come screaming down upon
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lancaster shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistook there, my friend; you&rsquo;re mistook
there. I&rsquo;ve guided many a party through the Rockies
and across the plains, and some of &rsquo;em from St.
Louis and Independence, and I never yet seed that
thing done. &rsquo;Cause why, it would be all tom-foolery,
with their loaded wagons, and jaded horses and sleepy
oxen; such a thing would be impossible&mdash;yes, sir, impossible,
even if all the Injins were on foot. You
see, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wainwright could not deny the force of what the
hunter said, and much against his will he was led to
believe that a party of hostile Indians were rapidly
nearing them. This, while it gave the hunter no uneasiness
as regarded themselves, looked as though the
emigrant train had gotten into trouble, and on that
account the three horsemen were more apprehensive
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
than they would have been under ordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>In the mean time the agents in this cloud of dust
were rapidly nearing the party of hunters, who, with
their horses upon a slow walk, were attentively watching
for some further evidence of the identity of their
enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; admonished Harling, raising his hand
with a gesture of silence.</p>
<p>All bent their heads and listened. Faintly through
the turmoil and confusion, they caught the sound of
shouting, as though the parties were calling to each
other; at the same time a faint rumble or trembling
was heard which showed that numerous animals were
tramping the prairie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look as though the emigrants were in
trouble?&rdquo; asked Fred, with an expression of familiar
alarm. &ldquo;I do hope they haven&rsquo;t been attacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a party of Injins driving a lot of animals,&rdquo;
said Harling. &ldquo;They have stampeded them, and if
you listen very hard you can hear the tramp of their
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the shouting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All as matter of course. They have got the animals
on a full run, and are shouting and yelling at
them to keep them going. Hark! How much plainer
you can hear &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the case; the fearful whooping of the excited
redskins coming to their ears with great distinctness.
Suddenly Lancaster&rsquo;s face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand now what it all means. A lot of
thieves have stampeded a drove of sheep and have &rsquo;em
on the full run so as to get them as far away from re-capture
as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be Apaches, then,&rdquo; remarked Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; and the hunter pressing his lips, &ldquo;them&rsquo;s
<i>Comanches</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they doing as far up as this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Lancaster looked at the interlocutor in surprise, and
then repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far up as this! Ten years ago I seed a party of
over twenty Comanches along the Yellowstone, a
thousand miles from here, and I&rsquo;ve seen hundreds of
&rsquo;em &rsquo;atween here and there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they rarely came so far north. I have
never seen any of them till yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunter laughed as he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of your taking the trouble to tell
us that; <i>I</i> never &rsquo;sposed you have. True, the most
of &rsquo;em sticks down in New Mexico, Texas and around
there, but they often come further north, just to get a
chance to stretch their limbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you tell them from the Apaches who
resemble them so closely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is rather a nice point, I&rsquo;ll own,&rdquo; said Lancaster,
&ldquo;with some professional points, but the fact is,
that since we&rsquo;ve been sitting on our horses, riding
and listening, I&rsquo;ve heard a scream given by one of
the dogs, that I&rsquo;ve heard afore and that always came
from the throat of a full blooded Comanche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me that if such is the case, the best
thing we can do is to get out of this region as rapidly
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was really the most sensible remark Fred
Wainwright had made for some time; and feeling it
to be such, he was not a little confused to see that it
attracted scarcely any attention. Finally, Lancaster,
who was still looking toward the tumultuous crowd
which was passing toward them, remarked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to pass to the north of us, between
us and the Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why we shall have a chase and all for nothing
too, and be kept away the whole day from joining the
party who are looking as anxiously for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, youngster,&rdquo; said the trapper, turning toward
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
their younger companion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking
about something that you don&rsquo;t know nothing about.
These Comanches are stealing them sheep, and they
want to get along with them as fast as they can, if not
faster; they have got no time to stop and fight, no
matter how bad they want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed right, for once in your life,&rdquo; remarked
Harling, &ldquo;you can see that the drove have
turned to the north, and when they pass us there will
be a good half mile between the Comanches and us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lancaster looked inexpressible things and kept silence.</p>
<p>The remark of the hunter, or rather his prediction
came true. In a few minutes, through the dust and
smoke, they could distinguish the forms of Indians
mounted on their mustangs, dashing hither and thither
in the most rapid evolutions, while the affrighted sheep
huddled together, or piled pell mell in their frantic attempts
to make faster time. The Comanches displayed
the most extraordinary skill in horsemanship, darting
hither and thither, sometimes under their horse&rsquo;s
belly, then over his neck, and in every conceivable position.</p>
<p>The Indians discovered the hunters at the same instant
that the latter saw them; but they did not give
them the least heed. They were too numerous to fear
any thing from the white men, and they knew they
had too much shrewdness to disturb them; and so the
mortal enemies passed within a comparatively slight
distance of each other, with no other evidence of recognition
than a mutual scowl of hate.</p>
<p>The hunters waited until a portion of the thick dust
had settled, when they resumed their march for the
point where they expected to meet the approaching
emigrant party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE EMIGRANT PARTY.</h2>
<p>The dust raised by the multitudinous drove of
sheep was so dense, as almost to suffocate the
trappers as they rode along, even when they waited
till the yelling, gyrating Comanches were far in the
west with their terror-stricken animals.</p>
<p>A thin coating of the powder settled upon their
garments, so that when they emerged with the free
air beyond, they were all of a yellowish white color;
but a vigorous brushing and shaking of their clothes
speedily resumed this, and they became themselves
again.</p>
<p>A half hour later, the party reached the &ldquo;Old Man&rsquo;s
Point,&rdquo; but as they swept the horizon, saw nothing of
the approaching emigrant train. The rocks themselves
were a mass of irregular boulders piled above
each other to the distance of fully a hundred feet,
while the base covered an area of fully a quarter of an
acre, so that no better spot could be selected as a
rendezvous, or from which to take observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred, go to the top and take a look!&rdquo; said Lancaster,
&ldquo;I expect they must be in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking of doing so,&rdquo; was the reply of
Wainwright, as he dismounted and began clambering
up the rocks. His agility soon carried him to the top,
and shading his eyes with his hands, he looked off
toward the east a moment, and then called out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They are coming!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make right sure,&rdquo; called Lancaster back to him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
&ldquo;for you are powerful apt to make blunders in this
part of the world. Be you sure they ain&rsquo;t Comanches
or Apaches or some other party of stragglers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the white tops of their wagons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right then,&rdquo; was the comment of
both the hunters below, as they considered that this
fact established the other truth.</p>
<p>Turning their heads in the direction indicated they
were able to discern the caravan, at that great distance,
apparently standing still, but, as they knew, moving
as rapidly as possible toward them.</p>
<p>Having assured himself that it was all right regarding
them Fred Wainwright turned his gaze toward
the vanishing Comanches and their stolen sheep.
There was no difficulty in locating them, as the vast
volume of dust indicated their whereabouts as unmistakably
as does the smoke the track of a fire on the
prairie.</p>
<p>The young hunter observed something which struck
him as rather remarkable. The Comanches, after
reaching a point, when it was plain they could not be
discerned by any one, standing at the base of the
Rock, made a bend fully at right angles to the course
they had been pursuing. This they continued, until
they grew faint and finally vanished from sight altogether.</p>
<p>This rather puzzled Fred until he mentioned it to
the two hunters below when he descended, when
Harling explained its meanings. From whomsoever
the Comanches had stolen the sheep, it was evident
they had fears of pursuit. It is the easiest thing in
the world to follow a sheep trail over the prairie; but, if
the pursuing party should ever happen, for the sake of
convenience, to leave the trail, they would be very apt
to take a general direction in their pursuit, without
going to the trouble of keeping to the main path. In
this manner, unless some such ruse were suspected,
they would never notice the change in direction made
by the thieves, and thus give the latter just what they
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
wanted, sufficient time to get themselves and their
prizes into safety.</p>
<p>But the emigrant party was now close at hand, and
Fred reascended the rocks and waived his hat as a
signal that all was right. This demonstration relieved
them in a great degree, for upon discerning the figures,
the company had come to a dead halt, and seemed to
be consulting together; but now they immediately
moved forward; and as the trappers moved out to
meet them, the two parties speedily mingled with each
other.</p>
<p>The emigrants numbered about a hundred,&mdash;ten
wives, a young woman, a half dozen children, while
the rest were strong, stout bearded men, well-armed,
and willing to dare anything in the defence of their
property. They had got pretty well used to Indians,
storms and danger in coming thus far, and felt considerable
confidence in themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve never traveled this way before,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Bonfield, a pleasant, middle aged man, who by
virtue of having the largest family, and owning
almost all the horses and wagons, was looked upon as
a sort of leader in the enterprise; &ldquo;and, of course
we ain&rsquo;t acquainted with the route. We engaged a
capital guide at St. Louis, but several days ago he was
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He oughter known better than that,&rdquo; remarked
Lancaster; &ldquo;if he learned enough to be a guide, he
oughter learned enough to take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did; but this was one of those things which
sometimes happens when we don&rsquo;t dream there is any
danger. He and Templeton here were chasing an
antelope, just at sunset, when they struck him, and he
limped a short distance, and finally tumbled over in a
small grove not a half mile distant from camp. Of
course they dashed after him, when, just as they went
down into the timber, I saw a flash from behind one
of the trees, the poor fellow threw up his arms, rolled
off his horse and fell dead to the ground. Templeton
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
dashed on into the grove, when a single Apache warrior
on foot, started on a run across the prairie, but he
hadn&rsquo;t taken a dozen leaps, jumping from side to side,
so as to distract his aim, when he put a ball through
his skull and laid him dead in his track. I suppose,
when the Apache saw them coming, he knew it meant
sure death to him, and as he did the best he could&mdash;shot
one and run for it; but who of us, if we had
been in the guide&rsquo;s place would not have done precisely
as he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; replied Harling. &ldquo;What was his
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Hackle?&rdquo; asked Lancaster, with considerable
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Joe; he and I trapped together for three
years on the upper forks of the Platte, and a braver or
better fellow never lived. He knowed every mile of
ground between the Mississippi&mdash;that is if you follow
the route travelers generally take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that reminds me that we were told that we
should find Mr. Ward Lancaster, and George Harling
at this place, and that they would act as our guide
into Lower California. I presume you are the gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yas,&rdquo; replied Lancaster with a huge grin,
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose we be: that is I&rsquo;m Ward Lancaster without
the <i>Mr.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bonfield laughed; for he evidently understood
what it all meant. The emigrant be it remembered
had halted, and the leader and several of the men had
advanced a hundred yards or so, and were consulting
with the hunters. The rest of the emigrants were
busy attending to their animals, or to themselves and
their private affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we engage you as guides?&rdquo; asked the leader,
unable to conceal his eagerness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think so, as we come out here for that
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no difficulty about the compensation;
for we need a guide badly enough. Most of my party
had concluded to halt here and wait until we could
procure one; and, although I opposed this conclusion,
I should have disliked very much to have penetrated
further into this country, which is entirely unknown
to every one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have done,&rdquo; said Wainwright.
&ldquo;You would have lost your way among the mountains
and every one of you would have been picked off by
the Indians before a week had passed over your heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought; or else taken prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Indians in these parts, ain&rsquo;t apt to take
prisoners, unless they are in the form of valuable
animals, or fair women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; said Lancaster, deeming it necessary
that the statement should receive his endorsement
before he could pass for genuine in such a promiscuous
company.</p>
<p>Mr. Bonfield and Lancaster now went apart by
themselves for a few moments, and talked together in
low tones. They soon rejoined the others when the
trapper announced that the arrangements were completed,
and they were to accompany the party to their
destination, which was Fort Mifflin, on the western
side of the Coast Range, or Rocky Mountains, in the
midst of a gold region. At the little town which
encompassed this fort, were a dozen of their friends,
who had been there a couple of years, and who had
sent for them. They had a young lady, whose father
was the principal man at Fort Mifflin, and who had
sent for his daughter to join him, at the time the party
crossed the plains.</p>
<p>The preliminaries being settled, the party rode back
to the emigrant train, made the acquaintance of the
others and the march was resumed. They had all
breakfasted, and it was concluded to make no halt
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
until they reached a small stream, which Lancaster hoped
could be found by noon, when they could rest as long as
they chose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part of the States are you from?&rdquo; inquired
Fred Wainwright, of the gentleman who had been referred
to by the leader as Mr. Templeton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missouri,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! what part of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young hunter could not avoid an exclamation of
surprise, uttered so naturally that the emigrant turned abruptly
toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;ahem!&mdash;I know several persons from that part of
the country&mdash;that is I used to know them, but it is a
good while ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton gazed at him sharply, and remarked by
way of explanation of his apparent rudeness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us are from there, and I thought at first
there was something in your voice that was familiar, but
I don&rsquo;t remember your name. We have a young lady&mdash;Miss
Florence Brandon, whose name you may have heard,
as she was a belle at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have heard of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to renew your acquaintance with
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I thank you; we hunters are hardly in a
condition to appear in the presence of refined ladies,
as I judge Miss Brandon to be, and our lives are such
that we should cut a sorry figure, if we attempted to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you talk like one who has not always led a
hunter&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some education, but at present, I am simply a
hunter and trapper.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Florence Brandon!</i> Little did Mr. Templeton dream
of the strange emotions awakened in the breast of Fred
Wainwright, the young hunter, at the mention of that
name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>

<br />LEONIDAS SWIPES, SHEEP DEALER.</h2>
<p>The sun had barely crossed the meridian, when the
emigrant party reached a small stream of water, and
made midday halt. The animals were fed, dinner
cooked and eaten, pipes smoked, and everything done
in accordance with the time and circumstance.</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright did his best to appear natural,
but since the mention of Florence Brandon&rsquo;s name,
his heart had been stirred, as it had not been stirred
for many a day. Old emotions which he imagined
were dead had&mdash;&mdash;but enough for the present.</p>
<p>When the call was made for dinner, he saw a young
lady descend from one of the large baggage wagons,
so remarkably handsome, as to cause an exclamation of
surprise and admiration from all who had not seen
her. The young hunter started and gasped, and then
passed his hand over his face, as if to make sure that
his massive beard was there, then he slouched his hat
so as to be sure the fair girl could not possibly recognize
him.</p>
<p>At meal-time, he managed to keep a goodly distance
from her; and, when pressed to go forward and make
himself known, he resolutely refused, and acted very
much as though he had a mortal terror of Miss Florence
Brandon.</p>
<p>The alloted time for rest had expired, and the party
were making ready to move on again, when three
strangers made their appearance mounted on rather
sorry looking nags. Two of them were dressed in half
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
civilized costume, with shaggy, untrimmed beards and
hair, and a remarkable talent for saying nothing
except when directly appealed to. The third would
have attracted attention in any part of the world,&mdash;being
nothing more nor less than a genuine, traveling
Yankee, dressed in precisely the same suit of clothes
in which he left his own native Connecticut a year
before. A huge, conical hat surmounted a small head,
from which sprouted a mass of yellow hair, a portion
of which protruded through an opening in the top,
while the rest hung down over his shoulders. Sharp,
grey eager eyes, a thin peaked nose, a yellow tuft of
hair on the chin, prominent cheek bones and bony,
angular muscular frame, completed the noticeable
points in the most talkative character in the group.</p>
<p>While the party were as yet nearly a hundred yards
distant, the Yankee called out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you folks, have you seen anything of any
stray sheep in these parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earnest simplicity with which this question
was asked brought a broad smile to the face of all
who heard it. Lancaster asked as the three horsemen
rode up,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;s! a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand, four hundred and twenty eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the remark of the horseman, it was evident
that the flock of sheep stolen by the Comanches
belonged to him and his party. Lancaster, therefore
had no hesitation in replying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seed a drove of almost that size go &rsquo;long this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you count &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good sized drove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right smart size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was driving on them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A half dozen Comanches.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our sheep!&rdquo; exclaimed the horseman
clapping his knee and turning his face toward his
companions, who merely looked their reply without
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t that mean!&rdquo; he asked, turning back
again toward the trappers and emigrants. &ldquo;My name
is Leonidas Swipes, and me and these two gentlemen
left New Haven, a year ago last April. All three of
us teached school in districts that joined, but we concluded
we was intended for better business, and so we
put our heads and purses together and started for
California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing with such a number of
sheep!&rdquo; asked Mr. Bonfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking &rsquo;em into California where mutton is five
times as high as it is east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you get the sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, the way on it was this,&rdquo; replied Mr. Swipes,
ejecting a mouthful of tobacco juice, rolling his quid
to the opposite cheek, and assuming a position of ease.
&ldquo;We started from St. Louis just at the beginning of
Spring, lost our way and afore we knowed it fetched
up in Santa Fe, five hundred miles off our course. Of
course, we were considerably riled to think we had
made such fools of ourselves, but there was no help
for it, and we soon found there was as good chance to
make money in Santa Fe, as in any other part of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Harling, &ldquo;it is one of the greatest
gambling holes this side of the Mississippi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Swipes instantly straightened himself with
righteous indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose we ever gamble? No, sir; such
things are frowned upon in Connecticut, and there
aint one of this party that can tell one keerd from
another. No, <i>sir</i>; we never gambled in our lives.
If you aint mistaken there, then my name aint Leonidas
Swipes,&mdash;no, sir; by jingo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get the sheep?&rdquo; pursued Mr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Bonfield, for there was something in the rattling
loquacity of the Yankee that made him interesting
and that caused the male members of the party to
gather around him. As the horseman found himself in
this pleasing position, he grew more voluble than ever,
and declaimed in a style and manner, which demonstrated
that while his two companions were mum, yet
his party in the aggregate did enough talking to
answer very well for one of its size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying it was rather queer, the way we come
in possession of them sheep, I swan if it wasn&rsquo;t. We
hadn&rsquo;t been in Santa Fe a great while, when a sickly
looking Missourian and a gander legged Arkansian
came into the town with this drove of sheep. They
tried to sell &rsquo;em, but nobody would give their price,
and one of &rsquo;em got out of patience, and turned his
horse&rsquo;s head around and started straight back for home.
The other staid at the hotel where we was, and got
took sick, and I soon seen he was going to die. As
I&rsquo;ve read law some, I axed him whether he hadn&rsquo;t a
will to make, and I&rsquo;d be happy to draw it up for him.
He said he hadn&rsquo;t a single friend in the world, except
the Arkansian, and he didn&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;d ever see him
again. He said he hadn&rsquo;t any property except the
sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, friends, I was not long in seeing there was
a fine opening for a young man, and the way I stuck
to that poor Missourian would have teached your hospital
nurses a lesson. I hope you don&rsquo;t think there
was any selfishness in it; for if any of you get sick, I&rsquo;ll
do the same for you. Howsomever, that aint here nor
there; the fellow died after awhile, and, in his will, it
was found that the five thousand and odd sheep had
been left to Leonidas Swipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to sell the drove to a couple of Mexicans,
when I happened to hear that sheep in California
was worth twenty dollars a piece. Jingo! wasn&rsquo;t
there a chance? That flock that I wast just on the
point of selling was worth over a hundred thousand
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
dollars, if I could only get it through the mountains.
I tell you the bare idea gives me the head-ache, I
swan if I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I told my friends here, Mr. Doolittle and
Birchem that if they&rsquo;d join, each of &rsquo;em could have a
third, and we&rsquo;d make our fortune. So we started, and
here we are without a sheep to our name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you expect to get through the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing has been done before and can be done
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you did not know the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we had a guide, but he played us a mean
trick. I agreed to give him a hundred sheep for his
payment, just as soon as he got us into the Sacramento
Valley. We hadn&rsquo;t been out three days, when one
night, he give us the slip, taking two or three hundred
sheep with him and leaving us to go alone. We felt
a little shaky about doing it, but we couldn&rsquo;t do anything
else, and so we shoved ahead, and by jingo
here you see us, only three sheep of us,&rdquo; and Mr.
Swipes&rsquo; face expanded into a broad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told us how these Comanches got
the sheep away from you?&rdquo; said Fred Wainwright,
echoing the curiosity that all the others felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish the <i>modus operandi</i> I presume, I can
soon give it, I swan if I can&rsquo;t. Last night we stopped
on a small stream of water, where we knew the grass
was so <i>succulent</i>,&mdash;so <i>succulent</i>, that the sheep would
stay there all Summer if we&rsquo;d only let them; and, as
we was pretty tired, and hadn&rsquo;t had a good night&rsquo;s
sleep since leaving Santa Fe, we made up our minds
to take a square night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we did so; and when I awoke this morning,
I looked around and seen our sheep about a half mile
distant, tearing away like mad, and a party of Indians
driving on &rsquo;em. Well, if you ever seen three Yankees,
you know what the matter was with us. We hopped
around there awhile, like a lot of chickens that had
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
stepped on a hot johny cake, and then we set off after
the Indians, shouting to &rsquo;em to hold on, while we
explained the matter to them; but hang &rsquo;em, they
only went the harder; and, as our horses was used up,
we had to give it up and yumer &rsquo;em along like to
keep &rsquo;em from giving out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been rather unfortunate,&rdquo; remarked
several, feeling really sorry for the unfortunate Yankees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I hope we can recover &rsquo;em agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we make a party and pursue them? I&rsquo;ll do
the fair thing with any of you that will join us. You
see it hardly looks smart to let a hundred thousand
dollars stray off in that style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot speak for the three hunters here, but it
would be hardly prudent for the rest of us to weaken
our force by dividing it when we are in such a
dangerous portion of the country,&mdash;but, I beg pardon,
we have forgotten the laws of hospitality. Have you
been to dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to observe that <i>we had not</i>, and we
would rather do that just now than anything else we
can think of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>

<br />FLORENCE BRANDON.</h2>
<p>Loss of property, grief and misfortune is almost
always sure to affect the appetite. A hearty vigorous
digestion is incompatible with depression of spirits, or
sudden paralysis of sorrow.</p>
<p>But Leonidas Swipes was subject to no such weakness,
so far as the loss of his magnificent drove of
sheep was concerned. How remote the prospect of
his recovering a tithe of his property, he was resolved
that it should interfere in no way with the meal before
him.</p>
<p>Himself and his two companions seated themselves
upon the ground, near one of the large baggage
wagons, while several of the females occupied themselves
with placing their food upon a matting before
them.</p>
<p>In the caravan were a couple of fine milch cows
which, although they had traveled all the way from
the States were in good condition and gave excellent
milk. When a large pitcher of the cool delightful
liquid was placed before the hungry horsemen, their
eyes expanded in amazement; but neither Mr. Doolittle
nor Mr. Birchem uttered a syllable, except when
Swipes asked them whether it was not splendid, whereupon
they replied with a grunt and nod of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I swan if it doesn&rsquo;t beat all I ever seed or
heerd tell on. That&rsquo;s the first drop of decent milk I&rsquo;ve
tasted since leaving Connecticut,&rdquo; said he, addressing
the elderly woman who was acting the part of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
waiter. &ldquo;We had some in Santa Fe, but it couldn&rsquo;t
begin with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, Swipes poured out a large cup-full,
and slowly drank off its contents, gradually lifting the
cup until it was inverted over his face thrown back so
far as to be horizontal. In this position, he held it for
some time until sure the last drop had descended into
his mouth, when he lowered it again with a great sigh
and a prolonged&mdash;&ldquo;A&mdash;&mdash;hem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is splendid now! <i>splendid</i>, by jingo! if it
isn&rsquo;t. When I had that up to my mouth, I just shut
my eyes, and there! I was back in Connecticut agin,
a sitting under the old mulberry tree, at noon, after
we have been mowing hay, and was taking our
lunch! Ah! I was a boy again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the hunters were eating, most of the emigrants
were consulting together, making the arrangements
for the day&rsquo;s journey, and debating the proposition,
the Yankee had made for some of them to join
in the pursuit of the thieving Comanches.</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright, feeling somewhat interested in
Swipes, sauntered slowly toward him, and took a seat
on the ground near the party, while they ate, that he
might relieve his depression of spirit somewhat by
conversing with the quaint New Englander, who, as
has been seen was more disposed to be loquacious than
anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say Mr.&mdash;&mdash;also Mr.&mdash;&mdash;what did you tell me
was your name?&rdquo; remarked the latter, as he suddenly
cast his eyes toward the young hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wainwright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mr. Wainwright, you belong to them trappers;
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, what do you think of my proposition. Fine
chance for a spec,&rdquo; said he, speaking rapidly and looking
shrewdly. &ldquo;&rsquo;Taint often you have such a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no particular feeling about it either way,&rdquo;
replied Wainwright. &ldquo;It is a big loss for you, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
we are bound to this emigrant party, having made an
engagement to accompany them through the mountains,
and don&rsquo;t believe Lancaster or Harling will
join you without the free consent of this party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the Comanches!&rdquo; exclaimed Swipes, as well
as he could, with his mouth full of meat, bread and
milk; &ldquo;hang &rsquo;em I say, they&rsquo;re up to all kinds of
tricks, I understand, but I think they have served us
just about the meanest one I ever heerd tell 'on. I
swan if they haint. I say, Mr. Wainwright, are you
much acquainted with the place over the mountains
where you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never have been there in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say; how in creation then are you going
to act as guide; that&rsquo;s what I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not the guide; it is Lancaster; he has been
on the mountains several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;ah! I understand; then he could tell me all
about the country. Have you ever heard him speak
of the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes; he has referred to it many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know whether there is a good opening
for a talented young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely these emigrants would be traveling
there through all this danger, unless there was a prospect
of their bettering themselves. But what sort of
business do you expect engaging in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anything most; I&rsquo;m handy at everything;
served my time as shoemaker, worked some at tailoring
and blacksmithing and on the farm, and teached
school in the winter. Say, you now,&rdquo; exclaimed
Swipes, with a sudden gleam of eagerness. &ldquo;What
kind of a place would it be to open a select school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young hunter could not forbear a laugh at the
simplicity of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could give you much encouragement
in that direction. The country is most too young
to give much attention to their schools, as yet, but
I&rsquo;ve no doubt there will be a fine chance in a short
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
time, for such an institution. I am quite aware there
is nothing more beneficial to a new settlement than a
church and school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say Mr. Wainwright,&rdquo; said Mr. Swipes, looking
up in the face of the young hunter, with no little interest.
&ldquo;You look to me and you talk just as if you&rsquo;ne
been a school teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed Fred, &ldquo;I never taught school a
day in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got larning enough to do so. I swan if
you haint! when I hear a man say <i>taught</i> for <i>teached</i>,
and <i>beneficial</i>, and all them kind of words, I always
set him down as knowing enough to teach school.
Perhaps you notice I don&rsquo;t allers speak grammatically
and call my words exactly right; but don&rsquo;t let that
give you the idea that I havn&rsquo;t got no education. I&rsquo;m
sensible of the mistakes after I make them, and when
it&rsquo;s too late to help &rsquo;em&mdash;&mdash;Jingo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonidas Swipes raised his hands in the most profound
amazement, as Florence Brandon suddenly
walked around the wagon, came up to where they
were sitting, and asked in the most musical of tones,
&ldquo;Is there anything more to which you will be helped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discomfited Yankee for a time was unable to
find his tongue. He sat gazing at the picture as one
enraptured. His companions now found their tongues,
and both replied that they were amply provided and
wished for nothing more, whereupon she turned and
disappeared.</p>
<p>Poor Fred Wainwright was in a dilemma fully as
sore as that of Swipes. He had no thought of the
girl until the exclamation of the latter. She halted
within a few feet of where he was reclining upon the
ground, and when Swipes became confused she turned
toward the young hunter, and looked in his face
with a smile as if she would like to have him join her
in the enjoyment of the scene. But Fred&rsquo;s face was
as red as a Comanche&rsquo;s when he looked up and encountered
those soulful eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Ah! those eyes with their deep heavenly blue! had
he not looked into them before? Those red lips! had
he not heard the sweetest words of his life come from
them? and that queenly head; had he not bent over
that! But stay! this will never do.</p>
<p>The minute he felt the eye of the young lady fastened
upon him he let his own fall to the ground, and had
his life depended on it he could not have raised them
again. He could feel that his countenance was burning
and fiery red, and his heart was thumping as it
never thumped before. Indeed he feared that he
should really faint unless he could recover himself.</p>
<p>He was enraged at himself for displaying such an unmanly
weakness, and by a strong effort of the will he
overcame his emotion&mdash;not enough to raise his eyes,
to catch a glimpse at the hem of her dress as she
flitted from sight again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be that she suspected me?&rdquo; he asked himself
where she had gone. &ldquo;No, I think she would not
recognize me in this dress. Then my beard conceals
my features, so that when I look into a spring, as I
am about to drink, I cannot believe that I am the person
I was a year ago. And my cap; I would hardly
know my own brother in it. I would not have her
know me at this time for the world, and I do hope
that her look at me raised no suspicion in her
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jingo!&rdquo; exclaimed Leonidas Swipes, as soon
as he could find tongue to express himself, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she
a picter? If I wan&rsquo;t engaged now, I&mdash;ahem! might
sail in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are engaged?&rdquo; remarked Wainwright,
glad to find an excuse for directing the attention from
his own awkwardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Yankee, resuming his eating in
a serious matter-of-fact matter. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m fast; and
if them Comanches hadn&rsquo;t stolen them sheep, I calculated
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
being in San Francisco in ten months from now,
to take passage in the steamer for hum, and to buy
Deacon Poplair&rsquo;s farm and settle down with Araminty&mdash;but
hangnation, the sheep are gone, and where&rsquo;s
the use of talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as if to draw his griefs clean out of his remembrance,
he ate more ravenously than ever.</p>
<p>But all that is temporal must have an end, and so
did the enormous meal of the three half famished
sheep dealers. When they had finally gorged themselves,
and were remounted on their animals, they by
no means were the woebegone-looking wretches that
might have been imagined, in those who had just
seen a hundred thousand dollars slip and escape off on
the prairies. On the contrary they seemed quite
cheerful. Messrs. Doolittle and Birchem were silent,
as a matter of course, but Leonidas looked greasy and
rather jovial.</p>
<p>As soon as the meal was concluded and the march
was resumed, the train heading a little toward the
north west, as Leonidas remarked they were some
distance north of the pass by which they hoped to
make their way through the mountains into Lower
California, which in reality was Southern California, a
considerable ways north of the Gulf, and not the peninsula
known by that name.</p>
<p>Leonidas Swipes was informed by the trappers that
they truly sympathized with the loss borne by him and
his friends, but their engagement with Mr. Bonfield
and the leaders of the train forbade them to unite with
them in the attempt to secure the sheep. In fact, the
trapper informed them that it was useless for them to
expect to regain their property. It would require but
a short time for the Comanches to reach one of their
villages, where they could marshal a hundred warriors
with which to defend their property; and mounted on
their swift mustangs, it was almost impossible to compete
with them.</p>
<p>It was a hard dose to swallow, but Swipes took it
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
philosophically, and persisted in believing there was
some hope of recovering them. At least, as the Comanches
took the same direction that the train was
following, he concluded to remain with the latter for
the present.</p>

<br />FORT MIFFLIN INSTITUTE.</h2>
<p>Until the great Pacific Railroad is completed, traveling
across the plains must always be a wearisome
labor. The rapid staging between many of the distant
points, has in a measure toned down this laborious
monotony; but, even with this improvement, hundreds
who have made the trip will testify to its wearying
sameness.</p>
<p>But, when an emigrant train starts forth it is the
very impersonation of monotony to an impatient spirit.
For a time the variety of landscape occupies the mind
and in a great degree relieves the tedium; but, although
some of the finest scenery in the world is in
the West, it soon loses its power to amuse, and all
feelings are absorbed in those of apprehension regarding
dangers and anxiety to get ahead&mdash;manifested in
some by a figuring and calculation as to the number of
suns that must yet rise and set before they can hope
to see their destination; in others to hurry and make
the best time possible, and in still others by a dogged
resolve to plod along without noting the distance traveled,
but with the intention of suddenly awaking to
the fact that they have completed their journey, and
their travels are at an end. The only objection to
carrying out this whim, is that he who undertakes it,
is sure to find himself in spite of all he can do to divert
his mind, looking for the <i>denouement</i> long before
it is due.</p>
<p>The emigrant train, which from this time forth
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
must occupy a prominent part in our narrative, was
one of those that have plodded patiently all the way
from the Mississippi, until now having passed three-fourths
of the distance, it was on the very border of
the wild regions of California.</p>
<p>On the whole they had experienced good fortune.
They had not lost an animal or a member of the
party since starting, excepting their guide who was
slain in the manner already narrated. Not a man, woman
or child had seen an hour&rsquo;s sickness, and all were
now in the best of spirits.</p>
<p>But they had encountered more hardships than
they anticipated, and on this day instead of having
such a stretch of wild wilderness before them, it was
their confident expectation to be at Fort Mifflin. They
had terrible times in crossing some of the swift rivers;
their horses had been carried away, and many a precious
hour had been spent in recovering them; ten of
their wagons had been hopelessly mired, and a large
portion of their most valuable goods had been whirled
away by the rushing torrents.</p>
<p>Then storms, whose fierceness they had never seen
equalled in their own home, had swept over the prairie,
causing them to tremble for their very lives&mdash;but
here at last they all were, secure, intact, with a skilful
guide at their head. So had they not every reason to
be thankful, to take courage and to press on?</p>
<p>Ward Lancaster appreciating the magnitude of his
charge, rode some distance at the head of the train,
his eye constantly sweeping the prairie, and his mind
taken up with the duty before him. He rode alone,
except when some of his friends chose to keep company
with him; but these generally found him as morose
and incommunicative, that they were glad to
fall back again and join the more sociable portion.</p>
<p>The horsemen were scattered all through the train,
so that in case of attack they could rally to the defence
of any portion without unnecessary delay. As naturally
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
was to be expected, intimate friends and acquaintances
found their way into each other&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>Warfield and Mr. Bonfield appeared to take a strong
liking to each other, for they rode side by side, and
chatted in the most pleasant and familiar manner.
Little was seen of Florence Brandon. Occasionally
she indulged in a few miles walk, but at other times
she was in one of the large lumbering covered wagons
with Mrs. Bonfield and a maiden aunt. Miss
Jamison, whose loquacity equalled that of Leonidas
Swipes, and whose bosom seemed incapable of any
emotion except that of the importance of keeping her
sharp eye and long nose turned toward her ward.</p>
<p>Messrs. Doolittle and Birchem rode side by side;
and as neither was heard to utter a syllable to the
other, there can be but little doubt but that they vastly
enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>Swipes was getting along handsomely. He appeared
to have recovered his spirits entirely, and to have
forgotten the brief time he enjoyed the bliss of expected
wealth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you Mr. Wainwright,&rdquo; said he, as he rode
beside him, shaking his head and gesticulating his
long arms, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve an idee.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it come into my head as I was riding along.
I tell you it is an idee <i>that is an idee</i>&mdash;bound to make
my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As sure as the sheep would have done had they
remained in your possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-es-s; but perhaps not quite so fast; but in a
much better manner; in a manner that shall make
my name famous along the Pacific coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be quite a grand scheme that has entered
your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i>!&rdquo; was the emphatic response. &ldquo;One of
those idees such as you don&rsquo;t get more than once in
a life time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish me to share your knowledge of it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I was preparing your mind for it like.
What do you think of the Fort Mifflin Institute for
the education of youths of both sexes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly <i>sounds</i> well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t it well&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it grand? And what do
you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to be a little more explicit in your
statements, before I can give you any decided opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as soon as we get to Fort Mifflin I shall
erect a building, to be called the Fort Mifflin Institute
for the Education of the Youths of both sexes.
I shall have a lot of circulars printed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you get them printed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Fort Mifflin, of course. I believe in supporting
home industry; I swun if I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wainwright laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no printing office within a hundred miles
of Fort Mifflin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! is that so? That&rsquo;ll make some trouble&mdash;not
much, however,&mdash;I can run up to San Francisco
or to Sacramento city; have a few thousand circulars
printed and distribute them on my way coming back.
Jingo! it&rsquo;s good I&rsquo;ll have to go so far, don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you obtain your pupils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From every part of California! Fact is, I should
not wonder, after the Institute becomes known thro&rsquo;
the Atlantic States, I should draw quite a number
from there. You see, Mr. Wainwright, I&rsquo;ve <i>teached</i>
before, and I&rsquo;ve got a reputation up in Connecticut.
What do you think of it, Mr. Wainwright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will succeed&mdash;hardly as well though
as you seem to anticipate. I presume you would run
the institution yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be the head of course&mdash;the principal; but
I shall organize a faculty at once. Mr. Doolittle there
will be just the man to be professor of mathematics,
and Mr. Birchem professor of the natural sciences.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get them to do enough talking to fill
their positions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty, plenty. Fact is, Mr. Wainwright, teachers
do too much talking altogether. They&rsquo;re just the
men for the position, I swan if they aint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor of Belles Letters, modern languages,
&amp;c. I&rsquo;ve got another idee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And totally unable to control himself Mr. Swipes
boiled over, laughed, gave utterance to several strange
squeaking screams, which drew all eyes toward him,
and wound up by declaring,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a grand idea&mdash;<i>grand</i>! oh! so grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let&rsquo;s hear it, and don&rsquo;t make quite such an
excitement!&rdquo; said the young hunter, feeling some
embarrassment at the attention which was being
drawn in his direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is grand&mdash;a grand idea, worth forty thousand
droves of such sheep as I lost; bound to make Professor
Swipes and the Fort Mifflin Institute for the
Education of the Youths of Both Sexes famous from
one end of the country to the other. What do you
think of the idea, Mr. Wainwright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell better when I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the head of the ladies&rsquo; department, I will
place, whom do you &rsquo;spose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Araminta, your beloved in Connecticut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no!&rdquo; was the somewhat hesitating response. &ldquo;I
propose to place Miss Florence Brandon! Aint that
grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the young lady who is a member of
this party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; who else could there be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must remember, my good friend, that
the consent of herself and father is to be gained in
this matter, before you would be warranted in publishing
her as the head of your department for the
instruction of young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her consent,&rdquo; repeated Swipes with the greatest
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
amazement. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why she&rsquo;ll be crazy at the
chance? You won&rsquo;t be able to hold her, when she
knows what a grand opening it will be for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin modestly, Mr. Swipes; begin modestly;
establish your school, get it in thorough operation,
and then look about you for a female assistant. Why
not send for your Araminta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, she isn&rsquo;t quite so pretty as this Miss
Brandon, and I&rsquo;ve thought of having Miss Brandon&rsquo;s
likeness published and distributed with the circulars.
I think it would help. I will mention the matter
to her the first chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my advice and don&rsquo;t do it; it will do no
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if you knowed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I know how any modest woman would act
under such circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was interrupted at this point by
the stoppage of the emigrant train, near a small
stream of water, and it was observed that Lancaster
was talking quite earnestly with the male members
who were gathered around him. Riding forward the
young hunter and Yankee heard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to scare you but there&rsquo;s a good sized
war party of Apaches in the hills yonder and they&rsquo;n
been following us all the afternoon, and we&rsquo;ll see more
of &rsquo;em pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />AN APACHE COURTSHIP.</h2>
<p>The trapper pointed toward a pile of wooded hills,
in which direction every eye was immediately drawn,
without discovering, however, the &ldquo;signs&rdquo; to which he
alluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve had a half a
dozen glimpses of &rsquo;em since we started. It won&rsquo;t be
long before you all see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In confirmation of the hunter&rsquo;s words, at this moment
a couple of mounted Indians were seen to come
forth from the wood and undergrowth, ride to the
bottom of the hill, where they halted as if waiting for
something. The next moment a half a dozen followed
them until ten were gathered together upon their
gaudily-caparisoned mustangs.</p>
<p>The next moment, they commenced riding at an
easy gallop toward the expectant train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jingo! they&rsquo;re going to tackle us!&rdquo; exclaimed
Leonidas Swipes in considerable excitement, and
with the hope of alarming those around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; replied Fred, &ldquo;Apaches don&rsquo;t do things
in that style; they generally take the night time and
steal upon their enemies unawares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such an approach in broad day generally means
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; persisted Swipes, as if unable to
comprehend what it all meant; &ldquo;the Apaches are not
on friendly terms with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;When it suits their purpose it may be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emigrants understood, as a matter of course,
that the approach of the redskins meant nothing hostile,
although more than one of them quietly examined
his rifle to make sure it was loaded and ready for instant
use.</p>
<p>A few moments later, the war party came to a dead
halt about a hundred yards distant, and the leader or
chief made a gesture of friendship, which was answered
in pantomimes by Lancaster, who muttered at the
same time to those near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of them dogs is Comanches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if they aint the ones that stole my sheep!&rdquo;
exclaimed Leonidas, sagely.</p>
<p>The preliminaries being arranged the chief now
rode forward, his warriors following at a distance of
a dozen yards or so. The emigrants reassured them
by signs that they were welcome, whereupon the
whole ten slid lightly from their horses, and, leaving
them stand without any fastening or guardianship,
came forward, until it may be said, they mingled in
with the whites, at which point they laid their arms
upon the ground, and waited for their white friends to
do the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put down your guns,&rdquo; said the trapper, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
what they&rsquo;re waiting for, but if you can hang on to
your pistols at the same time without their noticing
you, why I haint any &rsquo;bjection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swan, if I let go of my revolver,&rdquo; muttered
Swipes, as he shoved the weapon as far as possible
down his pantaloons pocket.</p>
<p>The Apaches now came forward, and seated themselves
upon the ground, placing themselves in a semi-circle,
while the circle was completed by a dozen of
the emigrants, including the hunters, Swipes taking
good care to occupy the centre of the Caucasian line,
so as to be as far away as possible from the American.</p>
<p>At this juncture, Mr. Bonfield whispered to Lancaster,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
who was sitting next to him, that the chief or
leader was the same fellow who had visited their camp
alone, about a week before. He was now painted and
bedaubed, with the evident intention of concealing his
identity, but Mr. Bonfield was sure he recognized
him. When finally he opened his mouth, and spoke,
the last atom of doubt was removed.</p>
<p>Lancaster nodded his head to signify that he understood
what it all meant.</p>
<p>At this point, the chief uttered an exclamation,
spoke several words, and lit a large ornamented pipe.
The trapper immediately replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you understand him?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bonfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he speaks the Apache tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He announced himself as Cherouka, mighty chief
of the Apaches, and that he was our friend, which
you know is the thunderingest lie ever told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cherouka took a few whiffs at the pipe, passed it to
his neighbor, who imitated him, and in this manner it
passed the entire circuit, including the white men.
This was an official declaration of friendship, but it
deceived no one.</p>
<p>The way being now opened, Cherouka recognizing
Lancaster, as his &ldquo;man,&rdquo; addressed his words to him,
while the trapper responded promptly and unmistakably.
The language, as a matter of course was all
&ldquo;Greek&rdquo; to the emigrants, who could only gain a
knowledge of its meaning, when their guide chose to
enlighten them.</p>
<p>The first remark of the Apache was a repetition of
his friendship, and his best wishes for the safe advance
of the party &ldquo;toward the setting sun.&rdquo; This was
&ldquo;chaff&rdquo; and was so understood by him who comprehended
the words, who replied in the usual diplomatic
manner, returning the hypocritical professions, and
seeking to draw the real meaning from the crafty
Apache.</p>
<p>But it seemed impossible to get any word from
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
Cherouka, explanatory of his true object in thus
visiting a camp of people, between whom and his own
kindred it was generally understood, the most implacable
enmity existed. This fact convinced the shrewd
guide, that the whole thing was a ruse to cover some
hidden design.</p>
<p>As Lancaster looked the painted redskin in the face
his own wits were busy, and his keen eyes constantly
wandered hither, and to make sure that he should
not be surprised by any sudden <i>coup-d&rsquo;etat</i> of the
enemy. Finally the presence of the two Comanches
in the party, gave him as he believed the correct
clew.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly these two gentlemen were concerned
in the theft of Leonidas Swipe&rsquo;s sheep; and, fully impressed
with the value of their prize, they were
resorting to every means to delay pursuit. They had
known or suspected of the union of the unfortunate
sheep dealers, with emigrants, and fearful that they
might thus organize a vigorous and dangerous campaign
against them, they had adopted this artifice of
keeping them and their friends off the scent, until the
plunder was beyond their reach.</p>
<p>Five thousand and odd sheep are not a very mobile
organization in a precipitous country; and if any one
thinks they are, we advise him to try the experiment
and undeceive himself.</p>
<p>Consequently the Comanches only displayed ordinary
sagacity in attempting the stratagem to which
we have referred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well, if it&rsquo;s no more,&rdquo; was the reflection of the
trapper, as these thoughts passed through his mind,
&ldquo;but these dusky scamps may have something behind
all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the interview progressed, the emigrants gradually
gathered around the parties. The curiosity,
naturally enough affected the women; and, when they
saw the Indians, in their war-paint and war-dress
seated upon the ground, gravely chaffering with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
whites, they too approached until they were within a
few feet of the parties.</p>
<p>As Fred Wainwright sat looking upon the face of
the Apache chief, during the interview, he noticed that
he kept gazing to his left as though something in
that direction attracted his attention. His looks
became so fixed at last, that he turned his head, and
then discovered that the all absorbing object which
had caught the dusky scamp&rsquo;s eye was no less a personage
than Miss Florence Brandon, who, occupied
in the scene itself was unconscious of the attention
which she had attracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jingo! he&rsquo;s smitten!&rdquo; whispered Swipes to the
young hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old dog is struck with her,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;and if we aint careful, there&rsquo;ll trouble come from
this. Just watch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never shall give my consent to his taking Miss
Brandon away; you see it would be a severe loss for
the Fort Mifflin Institute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open,&rdquo; was
the somewhat strong hint that Mr. Swipes received to
remain quiet during the progress of the interview.
He looked at the young hunter a moment as if he
were about to resent this insult to his dignity; but he
finally concluded to remain silent and look on.</p>
<p>Cherouka hadn&rsquo;t sense enough to conceal his admiration
of Miss Brandon or he didn&rsquo;t care if it was
observed. Fixing his sharp black eye upon the girl,
he suddenly arose to his feet and walked toward her.
Alarmed at the movement, she started back with a
slight exclamation, and the Apache chief found his
progress suddenly checked by Fred Wainwright the
young hunter, who strode across his path and waved
him back.</p>
<p>This occurrence created some little excitement, and
for a moment threatened serious consequences. The
brow of the chief darkened and he placed his hand upon
his knife handle; but, his second thought evidently
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
prevailed, and he sank back again, addressing Lancaster
the interpreter. The latter laughed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose he says?&rdquo; he asked turning to
his friends.</p>
<p>No one could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he loves that gal, begging her pardon, that
lady, and he wants her to go to his wigwam with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This caused a smile, but, as it was plain that the
chief was in earnest, all felt the propriety of hearing
his ridiculous passion, as if it were entitled to serious
consideration. Lancaster was therefore directed to
inform the dusky dog that his compliment was duly
appreciated, but that the &ldquo;White Plume&rdquo; could not
accept his offer.</p>
<p>This being duly communicated to Cherouka served
only to make him eager to secure the coy prize. He
instantly offered a large belt of wampum and two
horses for her. This was courteously but firmly
refused as before, whereupon he made still more extravagant
offers.</p>
<p>These meeting with the same fate as the others, he
demanded the reasons why his offers were refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I tell him?&rdquo; asked Lancaster, looking
at the blushing girl. &ldquo;Hanged if I know what
excuse to give him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him she&rsquo;s engaged!&rdquo; called out Swipes in a
husky whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell him you&rsquo;ve got another feller?&rdquo; asked
the trapper, with all the simplicity imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>No; tell him no such thing for I have not!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little did Florence Brandon dream of the vast
happiness produced by that declaration in the breast
of a certain young hunter standing near her, with his
eyes fixed upon her face with almost the keen eagerness
of the Apache lover himself.</p>
<p>The latter was made to believe, at length there was
no hope for his suit; and mounting his horse, he and
his followers rode away sullen, lowering and vengeful,
while the whites breathed freer, when the troublesome
visitors were fairly out of the range of the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />AN AUDACIOUS PROCEEDING.</h2>
<p>When the Indians, including the lover-like Apache
were fairly beyond hearing of the emigrants, they
ventured to indulge fully in their mirth.</p>
<p>There was something so inexpressibly ridiculous in
the facts of this courtship, which could only find
expression of laughter. None enjoyed it more than
the fair one concerned; she considered it the greatest
adventure of her life, and never wearied of listening
to all its particulars, from those who had taken a
closer observation of Cherouka&rsquo;s actions than she had.</p>
<p>But after all there was a serious side to this matter,&mdash;at
least the trappers concluded there was. They
understood perfectly well the treacherous nature of
these redskins, were certain that this chief would
neglect no means of securing the prize which had been
so decidedly refused him.</p>
<p>Believing it inadvisable to alarm their friends, they
discussed the matter among themselves. The conclusion
was that all three should stand guard that evening;
and that through the day, one or two of them at
least should keep unremitting watch.</p>
<p>When the suppers were eaten, several of the leaders
of the emigrant train were acquainted with the facts
of the case, while the others believed that only a
prudential course was taken to guard against the
thieving propensities of the redskins.</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright took his station near the wagon
which contained the sleeping Florence Brandon, and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
him no occupation could have been more delightful
than thus to watch by the side of her whom he loved,&mdash;yes,
madly loved: he confessed it, standing there
alone in the gloom of the night. This girl, who little
imagined that Fred Wainwright was not Fred Wainwright&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;ah!
well, perhaps the past was to
be a dream and perhaps not. At any rate his duty
just there was to stand guard over the fair being who
occupied his waking and sleeping thoughts to the
exclusion of almost everything else.</p>
<p>Not a minute&rsquo;s sleep visited the eyes of the Trappers
of the Gila, through that same summer night. They
passed from point to point, continually moving through
the train, among the wagons, and once or twice, one
or two of them passed out upon the prairie and scrutinized
every point visible.</p>
<p>The night was semi-dark,&mdash;a faint moon rising high
in the sky, now and then obscured by the passing
clouds. Occasionally the vision was able to penetrate
for several hundred yards, and then it was restricted
to a fifth of that distance.</p>
<p>Leonidas Swipes had scented the danger, and declared
that he would also keep guard during the night;
for he could not consent to run any risk of losing the
intended head of the female department of the Fort
Mifflin Institute. He averred that his sense of hearing
was so acute that he could instantly detect the
approach of any creature,&mdash;no matter if it was a
weasel, or the tiny serpent that sometimes moves
among the grass.</p>
<p>Mr. Swipes took his position just in the rear of the
large white-covered wagon in which Florence Brandon
was sleeping, all unconscious of the faithful
guardianship which was kept over her. Here he
leaned against the heavy rear wheel, and gave himself
up to cogitation.</p>
<p>The young hunter, toward the middle of the night,
made a circuit of the encampment; and, as he came
back, observed the figure of the man leaning against
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
the wagon, and concluded to test the extreme watchfulness
of which he had boasted. Walking rather
lightly, therefore, he approached him from behind, and,
finding he attracted no attention, he stepped more
heavily until he was making more than usual noise.
Still the vigilant sentinel did not turn his head, and
Fred noticed that he was muttering something to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt she&rsquo;ll be just the ticket, I swan if she
won&rsquo;t; but to wake her now, or to wait till morning is
the question. I&rsquo;d have a better chance to talk it over
with her, and by jingo! I&rsquo;ve a good notion to give the
wagon a rattle so as to wake her up&mdash;&mdash;<span class="sc">Injins!
Injins!</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant, the heavy hand of the young hunter
grasped the Yankee&rsquo;s shoulder, and, fully assured that
he was in the power of the dreaded Cherouka, he
sprang several feet from the ground, and shouted at
the top of his voice; but, confronting Wainwright,
and immediately comprehending his mistake, added
in fully as loud a tone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">No Injins! No Injins! I was mistaken!</span> Jingo!
what&rsquo;s the use of scaring a fellow that way?&rdquo; he
demanded, still shivering from the shock he had
received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were so easily frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you come on a feller so suddent like,&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
give me time to collect my presence of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is about the style that a redskin would have
approached you, except that instead of his hand, he
would have brought down his tomahawk on your
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! I s&rsquo;pose he would, but then I
wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ve let him come in that style. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ve fout
him mighty hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me, you would detect the approach
of an Indian, no matter how stealthy he came up to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so I would.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come up like an Indian, as you say
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that; I made twice as much noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just the reason I didn&rsquo;t notice you; if you
had come up natural like,&mdash;that is as one of your
genouine redmen always do, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ve heard you, you
may be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would have been the consequence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have whipped round with the quickness
of lightning, if not a little quicker, and blowed the
audacious redskin to blue blazes, before he would have
known anything or could have said Jack Robinson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, a figure suddenly appeared among
them, which quickly resolved itself into Ward Lancaster,
their guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this h&uacute;bub about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, Mr. Lancaster, nothing at all,&rdquo;
replied Swipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I aint powerful mistaken, I heern some one
yell out that the Injins were coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus fairly detected, the Yankee was compelled to
acknowledge the truth, and receiving a warning from
the trapper to &ldquo;put a stopper in his meat-trap,&rdquo; the
guide sauntered away to his own post of observation
where he remained until the break of day.</p>
<p>Finally morning came, and with it the pleasant fact
that nothing had been seen or heard of a single redskin
since the departure of the party the evening
before. This was a pleasant fact we say, and was a
great relief to the trappers, who had concluded to a
certainty that there would be trouble before the night
passed.</p>
<p>As soon as it was fairly light Lancaster and Harling
rode out on the prairie and took a survey of the
surrounding country to look for signs of their enemies.
They scrutinized the hills closely, but with the same
result,&mdash;nothing was seen or heard regarding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep a sharp look-out for the warmints to-day,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
and if we don&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em, why it&rsquo;ll <i>kinder</i>
look as though they didn&rsquo;t intend to trouble us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fear, I suppose, is that Cherouka became so
desperately enamored with the young lady we have in
our charge that he may try to take her away from us
against our will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injins are queer critters,&rdquo; replied the guide, &ldquo;and
it&rsquo;s just like &rsquo;em to try some such a trick. I&rsquo;ve knowed
of such things before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow was desperately smitten, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled the trapper, &ldquo;but not much more
than another person we&rsquo;ve got with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; demanded Fred innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him as riding alongside of me on his horse. They
call him Fred Wainwright I b&rsquo;leve; and, if I aint
powerful mistaken, the gal has took quite a shine to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor young hunter almost sank from his beast.
He never dreamed for an instant that any one suspected
his secret, and he now feared that it had been
discovered by all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot me, you&rsquo;re red in the face as a b&rsquo;iled lobster,&rdquo;
laughed the guide perfectly merciless. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain
enough you&rsquo;re gone any way. Wal, she&rsquo;s a pretty
critter to look and to have take a hawkerin&rsquo; for a
feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she has noticed me,&mdash;that is&mdash;that
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loves you, why don&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that. When you stepped in atween the
Apache and her, all so sassy and bold, I could see
plain enough she rather liked your way of doing
things. I think everything is plain sailing for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a vast deal of comfort in the words of the
honest hearted trapper, and the young hunter reflected
upon them many a time through the day. They stirred
old emotions in his breast, and nothing that could
have been said by any one&mdash;always excepting the fair
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Florence herself&mdash;could have been more prized or
imparted a greater degree of pleasure.</p>
<p>The journey of the train was resumed, and progressed
through the day without any incident worthy
of record. The character of the country changed, becoming
more rugged and precipitous and they came
in sight of several snow-covered peaks, towering
against the blue sky beyond, like masses of white
clouds. Now and then, too, a breeze of wind&mdash;chilling
and penetrating swept over them, bringing
the climate of these icy regions with it.</p>
<p>Mr. Swipes introduced himself to Miss Brandon
during the afternoon, and regaled her for over an hour
with his plans for the successful establishment of the
Fort Mifflin Institute, greatly to her edification and
amusement. She listened patiently to him, and then,
as in duty bound, referred him to &ldquo;papa,&rdquo; with which
the enthusiastic educator was compelled to content
himself for the time being.</p>
<p>A sharp vigilance was maintained during the entire
day; but nothing was seen of wild Indians although
there was any abundance of wild animals. This fact
led the trappers to the hope and half belief that they
would suffer no further molestation from Cherouka and
his party at least.</p>
<p>The encampment at night was in a small beautiful
grove, on the banks of a tiny stream of icy cold water,
where abundance of the best of fodder was found.
Everything was arranged with the usual care, and, as
the trappers were considerably wearied, Lancaster and
Wainwright concluded to obtain a good night&rsquo;s rest,
while the opportunity was given them. There was no
saying when a like chance would occur.</p>
<p>Harling remained up, taking a general oversight of
the sentinels, while Swipes, as before placed himself in
the vicinity of the wagon, containing the precious
person of her whom he intended should help him make
a fame and fortune in the State of the Golden Gate!
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
He affirmed that she could not be safe unless he were
in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>It was far beyond midnight, and Leonidas Swipes
was soundly sleeping, when a shadow emerged from
the darkness that surrounded the grove, and stole as
noiselessly forward as a phantom. Straight toward the
wagon it glided. Sh! it pauses and glares around in
the darkness; the sentinel is soundly sleeping&mdash;now it
enters the rear of the wagon; there is a slight sound
but not enough to wake the dilatory sleeper&mdash;the next
moment he reappears bearing a form in his arms, with
his broad hand pressed over her mouth,&mdash;with the
same absolute silence it steals through the encampment
and the next moment Cherouka, the Apache chief has
vanished and with him Florence Brandon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />PREPARING FOR THE PURSUIT.</h2>
<p>Just as day was breaking over prairie and mountain,
a succession of ear-splitting shrieks issued from the
wagon in which Miss Sillingsby had passed the night.
They were so terrific and rapid that in a few minutes
the whole camp was active, and the people hurrying
toward the poor lady, and anxiously inquiring the
cause of her alarming terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Florence! Florence! Florence! I shall die!
I shall die! Oh! what will Mr. Brandon say! I wish
I was dead! I wish I was dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long time before she could be quieted, and
then the dreadful truth became known. Florence Brandon
was missing!</p>
<p>With the first shriek of Miss Sillingsby, a suspicion
of what had occurred flashed through the minds of
Lancaster and Wainwright with the instantaneousness
of an electric thrill. They were sleeping together
near one of the large camp fires, and they instantly
sprang to their feet; but, instead of running to the
wagon toward the shrieker, they hurried outside the
encampment and the grove, and gazed around in
search of some evidence of this excessive fright. It
is scarcely necessary to say that they discovered nothing
at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn&rsquo;t as bad as we imagine!&rdquo; said the
young hunter, addressing his elder companion, for the
first time since they had risen from their sleep. &ldquo;It
may not be <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Lancaster shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a fool to go to sleep; we&rsquo;ve been outwitted
by that infernal Apache. I feel it in my bones.
He has stolen in on her while we were asleep and
walked off with that critter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us find out the truth from Miss Sillingsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;spose we may as well, &rsquo;though I know what it
is,&rdquo; muttered the trapper, as he sullenly complied
with the request.</p>
<p>Miss Sillingsby, in answer to the clamorous demands
made upon her, finally let the truth ooze out. Near
the middle of the night, as she imagined, she dreamed
of seeing a terrible Indian crawl into the back part
of the wagon and carry off her ward. It was so
dark that she could only catch a glimpse of him as he
came in and went out.</p>
<p>She woke up with a conviction that her dream was
true; and now that she was awake long enough, she
was satisfied that it was no dream at all, but an actual
occurrence that had taken place before her eyes.
Hence her excitement.</p>
<p>Then did the cheeks of the females blanch with terror.
Florence Brandon spirited away in the night by
an Apache Indian! The very thought was enough to
fill one with shuddering terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is gone,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Sillingsby,
wringing her hands and threatening to go into hysterics
again. &ldquo;She is gone, and what is to become
of me and her poor father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by jingo!&rdquo; wailed Leonidas Swipes, darting
hither and thither and fairly dancing in excitement to
the tune of the lamentations around him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
to become of the Fort Mifflin Institute for the Education
of the Youths of Both Sexes? Gone up, and
my hopes and fortunes dashed to the ground; jest as
they always get dashed when they are about to bud
and blossom; I swan if they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here, my man,&rdquo; called out Fred Wainwright,
&ldquo;you acted as sentinel last night&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe&mdash;come to think, I am almost sure I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you took this wagon of Miss Brandon&rsquo;s under
your special charge, as you were satisfied that was
the only way of making her safe; you did this, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe&mdash;come to think I s&rsquo;pect I did do something
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what kind of a sentinel are you?&rdquo; demanded
the young hunter, contemptuously, &ldquo;to allow an Indian
to come in here at night and steal her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jingo, I don&rsquo;t understand it; I swan if I do;
I must have been&mdash;ah&mdash;have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, oh no; I was abstracted at the time&mdash;absorbed
in the investigation of some great truth
which made me oblivious, as it were, to what else was
going on around me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the first fever of excitement was over,
and the people began to converse rationally upon the
all-absorbing subject, while the trappers occupied themselves
in searching through the camp for some evidence
of the direction taken by the audacious Apache
with his prize.</p>
<p>When it was stated that the entire grove had
been traversed back and forth by the men and animals,
it will be seen that this was about impossible,
even when all three of the keen-eyed hunters set themselves
to work at the task, passing back and forth and
scrutinizing every foot of ground.</p>
<p>But upon the outside of the encampment, beyond
the range of the travel by the whites, Lancaster detected
the print of a moccasin in the dusty earth. He
followed it for twenty yards out upon the prairie, and
then looking up, saw that it led directly toward a
clump of trees about a quarter of a mile distant, and
along the branches of the creek on which they were
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
encamped&mdash;the stream making a sharp bend just
above where the train halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find something there,&rdquo; said the old hunter,
pointing toward the tree, &ldquo;the snip has made for that
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And left it as soon as he reached it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so; but he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone there, if
it wasn&rsquo;t for something particular. Let&rsquo;s go and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hunter hurried over the prairie, and in a few
minutes reached the trees. Here, upon looking down
at the ground, they were rewarded with another sight
of the trail, proving the correctness of the conclusion
at which Lancaster had jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll soon see what it all means,&rdquo; he said, as he
passed in among the trees.</p>
<p>It required but a moment indeed; a sudden &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
was heard from the old hunter and he pointed down
to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horse tracks, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that tells the whole story; the scamp had his
horse fastened among the trees, and has toted the gal
here as fast as he could travel, mounted his critter and
then put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we follow any further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t see as there is any use just now, as
we haint got our horses; we&rsquo;ll go back to camp and
let &rsquo;em know what we&rsquo;ve learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright all this time was in a fever of
excitement, although he had made superhuman efforts
to conceal it from his practical companion thus far;
but he began to be seriously alarmed at the coolness
and indifference which he manifested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward,&rdquo; said he, endeavoring to speak in a matter-of-fact
tone, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to follow these scamps, are
we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise you they&rsquo;ll get such a chase as they
never dreamed of; but you know enough to understand
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
it&rsquo;s going to be work and not play. That Apache
having got his hands upon the gal, won&rsquo;t let her
go in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the Apaches are an ugly set of people.
How do you suppose they will treat her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as the folks out east would treat General
Washington&rsquo;s mother, if she was alive and should go
through the country. Cherouka wants to make her
his squaw, and the old fool will try and win her love
by kindness. No; we may take a week to capture
her in and bring her back just as unharmed and free
from insult as she was before she heard of Cherouka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O heavens! Ward, you cannot imagine how much
you have relieved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seed you was kinder worked over it, though
your&rsquo;ne been trying mighty hard to keep it from me,&rdquo;
replied Lancaster with a sly grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; who is there in our whole party that
doesn&rsquo;t feel terrible over it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;a&mdash;s, I know, but I reckon you feel a little
terribler than the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do though; don&rsquo;t try to play any of your
foriniky tricks on me, Fred; I&rsquo;m an old enough
coon to know what it all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the case where is the use of any reference
being made to it, by either you or me?&rdquo; asked
Wainwright.</p>
<p>Lancaster and Wainwright made their way back to
camp, where they had found the excitement among
the females had increased, while upon the men it had
settled into a determination, that if it were possible
for mortal man to rescue the fair captive, it should be
done. Not a man among them all but was ready and
anxious to join in the pursuit.</p>
<p>Time was precious, the guide, who from his position,
naturally fell into that of a guide in other matters,
determined to organize the pursuit at once. It
would be madness to think of allowing all the men or
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
a majority to undertake the business, as the train was
in a dangerous part of the country, and such a proceeding
would invite their destruction by the thieving
hordes who would be very quick to discover their defenceless
condition, and take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Ten men well mounted and armed were all he
needed, and he selected these at once. It is hardly
necessary to say that himself and Wainwright were
the first two. Harling, it was concluded best, to
leave with the train, where his knowledge and watchfulness
would detect the very first opinion. Mr.
Templeton and seven others, whose appearance
struck the trapper as being favorable, were then selected&mdash;he
expressing the belief that each of them
possessed the requisite amount of &ldquo;grit&rdquo; for the business
before them.</p>
<p>Leonidas Swipes insisted that he should accompany
the expedition. It may have been that he felt an obligation
in the matter, thus to seek to repair, in so far
as possible, his shame or rather remissness as a sentinel;
or, it may be, that his shrewd mind saw a slight
opportunity of gaining some knowledge of the five
thousand and odd sheep which had been so unceremoniously
taken from him.</p>
<p>But Lancaster would not count him as an effective
man, and as it came about that the Yankee made the
eleventh or odd man, a matter which created much
merriment, but no ill will upon the individual concerned.</p>
<p>Mr. Bonfield remained with the emigrant train. At
the advice of the guide he agreed to throw up some
temporary fortifications, to insure safety in case of attack.
It was not at all improbable that the eleven
men would be seen as they rode away, by the sharp
eye of some prowling Indians, who might deem the
occasion just the one, in which to make an attack on
the remaining ones in the hope of securing plunder,
and perhaps destroying the whole party. The loss of
their animals would be an irreparable one just as they
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
were entering that mighty wall of rocks and chasms
which separate California from the territories, where
every ounce of their animal strength would be needed.</p>
<p>Mr. Bonfield&rsquo;s intention was to make a sort of
&ldquo;outer wall&rdquo; to inclose the entire encampment, and
from behind which, in case of attack, he and his men
could rain their bullets upon the redskins, without
fear of return.</p>
<p>The eleven men were mounted on the fleetest and
best animals that could be selected from the party,
and the sun was hardly above the horizon, when they
rode forth in their attempt to rescue Miss Florence
Brandon from the hands of Cherouka, the Apache
chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />PURSUIT.</h2>
<p>Fairly outside of the encampment, the little party
of hunters struck wide a sweeping gallop toward the
hills where Lancaster had discovered the evidence of
Cherouka&rsquo;s having mounted his horse and fled. Here
he made another examination of the ground, when he
discovered the direction the trail took, his manner
showed that it was precisely what he anticipated and
desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that grove yonder?&rdquo; he asked of his
men, pointing toward a clump of trees about a mile
distant. As a matter of course all replied in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, now, we&rsquo;ll just not notice the trail and
strike a bee line for them trees. If we find the trail
there, and p&rsquo;raps a few other horse&rsquo;s feet, there it is all
right and I know just where to look for the Apaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he again loosed his rein, and the whole
eleven went galloping almost in a compact body across
the country, toward the grove which had been indicated.
In doing so, all of those who were capable of
doing so, observed that they left the trail, in taking
another course. They, and among them was our hero,
the young hunter, looked upon this proceeding with
strong misgivings as to its prudence. It was a comparatively
easy matter to follow the footprints of the
horses over the open plain, and this leaving it for a
doubtful matter, looked like a waste of precious time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>However, Ward Lancaster was the leader of the
expedition, and he was the last one who should attempt
to gainsay any command of his.</p>
<p>A few minutes brisk ride brought them to the grove
in question; and on the very edge of the timber, the
eyes of all were gladdened by a sight of fresh tracks of
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I expected,&rdquo; remarked Lancaster, as his
grey eyes sparkled with pleasure. &ldquo;The rest of the
dogs waited him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a half dozen; don&rsquo;t you see where their horses
have gnawed the bark off the trees? Six of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swan we ought to be able to manage <i>them</i>, without
difficulty,&rdquo; remarked Swipes. &ldquo;Just foller &rsquo;em
up, sail in a dash around: that&rsquo;s my advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; replied Fred with a shake of the
head, while Lancaster did not deem it worth while to
notice the Yankee&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I tell you, my friend, that&rsquo;s just the
thing, and jingo, I claim the credit of originating
that&rsquo;ere idea. Like all of mine it&rsquo;s rather hefty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about the most foolish plan that could be
proposed,&rdquo; said Fred, a little anxious to take some of
the conceit out of the fellow, &ldquo;and is the one which
would be sure to be the death of the girl, we hope to
rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the quickest plan that could be devised to
ensure Miss Brandon&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me how,&rdquo; added Swipes, with the air of a
man who had proposed an unsoluble puzzle. &ldquo;Demonstrate
that as we say in geometry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose now that we should catch sight of this
party of Apaches, out on the prairie, and should dash
away after them at the top of our speed. There are
six of them and eleven of us: what do you suppose
would happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d drop the lady like a hot potatoe, or else
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
put her in a safe position and then turn round and
fight us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young hunter laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither; they would see that there was no chance
of getting the girl away, when they would tomahawk
her, leave her dead on the plain, and then do their best
to take care of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Swipes, perfectly
aghast, &ldquo;that would never do! Tell, Mr. Lancaster,
I recall that advice, and do not risk him to follow it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no necessity of going to that trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there is no danger of his following it; he
knows too much; and, Mr. Swipes, you will allow me
to suggest that it looks rather out of place for you or
me, who never saw a prairie, except a short time ago,
to attempt to advise a man who hunted upon them
before either of us were born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonidas could only stare his surprise, as the hunter
allowed his horse to walk around to a point a few
yards away, where Lancaster was earnestly discussing
some matter with several of his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo; muttered the Yankee, as he gazed
after him, &ldquo;but I swan, I think it served me about
right; that&rsquo;ere Lancaster knows more about the prairies,
and the mountains and Indians in one week than
I could learn in my life time; so, after this, I&rsquo;ll keep
still that is so far as giving advice is concerned, though
I do think I might give him a good idea now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Lancaster was talking about something which
interested all, Swipes concluded to join the group
around him, and learn what it all meant. Just as he
did so, it seemed matters reached a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied,&rdquo; said Lancaster, with a decided shake
of his head, &ldquo;I know just what point them dogs are
aiming at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chevenine Hills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;And where are they?&rdquo; asked several.</p>
<p>The trapper turned his head, as if he expected to
see them, and then answered.</p>
<p>The guide now spoke as a man speaks who has been
long debating a matter in his mind, and has at length
reached a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have knowed you couldn&rsquo;t see the Chevenine
Hills; they&rsquo;re off to the South, a good fifty
miles from here. There&rsquo;s many a traveler that remembers
them, for it&rsquo;s a great place for Apaches; they hide
in there, and you never see nothin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em, till they
come yelling and whooping down from the hills and
woods, and sail through the train, shouting, tomahawking
and raising all the hair they can. That&rsquo;s where
these dogs have gone, or have started to go and we
must head them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; ventured several who felt
this was too serious a matter to run much risk about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of you had ever seen the place you wouldn&rsquo;t
ax me the question. The reason why I think so is
this: The Chevenine Hills may be said to be the gate
of the Apache country&mdash;that is from a hundred miles
around these parts. From here to there is a broad
level plain, and south of them for a hundred miles
stretches a low level valley, making the best kind of a
country for traveling for horses and men, while if you
take any other route, you&rsquo;ve mighty rough traveling
through the mountains, and canons and rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have they not got too far ahead of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think they have; they&rsquo;ve got only a few
hours&rsquo; start, and have gone along the eastern ridge
which would carry them ten miles to the north till they
got pretty near the hills, when they&rsquo;d have to bend to
the right of course. Then they&rsquo;ve got the gal and
they&rsquo;ll travel more careful than if they hadn&rsquo;t her; for
when a feller is in love with a gal he&rsquo;s mighty careful
how he treats her. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Fred Wainwright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; responded the young
hunter, his face turning the color of scarlet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Leonidas Swipes hastened to say.
&ldquo;<i>I</i> can answer that question by experience. When a
young man is in love, he&rsquo;s sure to treat his young lady
as tender as if she&rsquo;s a sick kitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see we&rsquo;ll take the western side or ridge of
this plain; this will keep, the two parties so far apart
that there&rsquo;ll be no danger of our running together, and
we&rsquo;ll do some pretty sharp riding and get there ahead
and be ready to nab &rsquo;em when they come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we are mistaken after all,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Templeton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; enquired Lancaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may get in ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; was the decided reply. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re
mind to put our horses to it, we can get six hours ahead
of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may have taken another route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to say then, Mr. Templeton, is that if
you know so much you&rsquo;d better take charge of the
business and work it out to suit yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton looked at the wrathful trapper a
moment, then quietly smiled and slapped him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you don&rsquo;t say so, Ward, do you? Are you
really in &lsquo;<i>airnest</i>&rsquo;? Let&rsquo;s take a <i>chew</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which he thrust an enormous plug of tobacco
under the nose of the trapper, who was compelled to
smile in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll take a chaw,&rdquo; said he, thrusting the
whole piece in his mouth and then changing his mind,
and wrenching off about a third he added as he stowed
the rest somewhere about his person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course you don&rsquo;t want it after it has been in
my mouth, so I&rsquo;ll just save it till I want another chaw.
Come, boys, we&rsquo;re losing time; let&rsquo;s be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without parleying further, Ward Lancaster
struck his horse into a rapid gallop, the others following
rapidly behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git up! Confound you!&rdquo; called out Swipes, &ldquo;I
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
swan if I can get this horse off this infarnal trot which
nearly jolts the life out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at this point, the animal broke into a rapid
canter, and it may be said that the real journey began.
It was yet early in the day, and the horses being fresh,
and numbering the very best that the emigrant train
could afford, they were fully able to bear a strain.</p>
<p>And the guide did not spare them. He took the
eastern route, where the traveling was somewhat
rougher, and his gallop soon grew into what almost
was a run. The sun reached the meridian, and still
he did not show any signs of abating his speed. When
it was considerably past, they reined up near a small
stream, watered their horses and gave them a breathing
spell.</p>
<p>Leonidas Swipes rode up beside the guide and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mr. Lancaster, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a rather good
idea to&mdash;that is to take lunch just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stay and eat if you choose, but the rest
of us don&rsquo;t wait for that; or they can eat on the way,
but we don&rsquo;t stop agin till we&rsquo;re among the Chevenine
Hills. Come, boys, we&rsquo;ve no time to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they remounted and sped away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />THE APACHE GORGE.</h2>
<p>Lancaster the guide, in his reference to the Chevenine
Hills, had described them quite aptly. A long
sweep of level country, containing thousands of square
miles, was divided by a ridge of hills, which after
making a long sweep went straight across the country.
At one point in this wild ridge, there was a pass
through which the Indians traveling north and south
naturally made their way, in preference to climbing
and clambering for a quarter of a mile through and
over rocks, chasms and gorges, dangerous to horses
and sometimes to men. This was the famous &ldquo;Apache
Gorge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This famous spot was notorious to emigrants for its
danger. Those who were journeying toward the most
southermost part of California generally passed thro&rsquo;
the gorge, and those who did as if wise were fully prepared
for an assault from the vigilant Apaches or Pah
Utahs. Indeed many preferred when it was possible
to labor through the hills, when such a thing was within
the range of human possibility, in preference to
braving the perilous pass.</p>
<p>It was this point at which the trapper had aimed,
and toward which he pressed his horse to the utmost.
It was scarcely past noon when he pointed to a ridge
rising in the sky, clearly defined against the blue horizon
beyond, which he informed them were the Chevenine
Hills, and he was soon able to locate precisely the
&ldquo;Apache Gorge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the spot,&rdquo; he added an hour or two later,
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
&ldquo;where if the gal is ever seen again you&rsquo;ve got to lay
hands on her. If the redskins get through there with
her I don&rsquo;t see as there is much chance of our getting
sight of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the two parties, the Indians and whites were approaching
the Apache Gorge at the same moment, it
will be seen that they must rapidly converge. The
former it was supposed, (and there was every reason
for believing it to be the fact,) were coming down the
eastern, while the latter were following the western
ridge. As both had the same objective point, as a
matter of course they were rapidly nearing each other,
and must finally come together.</p>
<p>Whichever party reached the Gorge first, it may be
said, commanded the situation. If the Apaches had
passed through, the fact in itself was evidence of a
speed which would carry them safely beyond danger.
If they had not done so, then it only remained for
the whites to make their arrangements and await
their approach.</p>
<p>The whites now saw the keen wisdom and foresight
of their guide. What apparently seemed a
rash risk on his part, it was now plain was the only
plan which offered the least success, and was the only
one which in any degree could deceive the Indians
themselves. In the first place in penetrating their
destination was a fine exploit which won half the battle,
and in the next place, the course of leaving the
trail and heading off the Indians was the only plan of
surprising them&mdash;and in this lay the only hope of
rescue.</p>
<p>Beyond a doubt, the Indians expected to be pursued.
Where would they look for their pursuers behind
or in front? Had they any reason to believe or
even to suspect that there was any one among the
emigrants shrewd enough to suspect the Apache
Gorge? Was it likely that one man in a thousand,
in attempting to follow an enemy would take any
other course than follow his trail? Who so audacious
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
as to strike across the country and seek to head him
off? Seeing nothing of the whites as they neared
the pass, there was scarcely a possibility that they
would expect to find them <i>there</i>.</p>
<p>All this we say the party saw, and gladly acknowledged
the superior sagacity of the unlettered guide.
Mr. Templeton, offering the trapper a segar, said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward, I&rsquo;ve something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, let&rsquo;s hear it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now within a few miles of the hills, and
were riding at a more leisurely gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just found out that you know more in five
minutes than all the rest of us here knew in our lifetimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean about the prairies and Injin signs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, all I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; said the trapper with a
broad grin, as he proceeded to light his segar. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to know much to know that; you&rsquo;re
the biggest set of lunkheads I think I ever came across,
always barring Fred here, who hasn&rsquo;t been out in
these parts a great while, but long enough to learn
and keep his mouth shet when them as knows more
are talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is a very modest way of accepting a
compliment,&rdquo; laughed Templeton. &ldquo;I supposed you
might perhaps find it possible to say a word or two in
our favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoogh! wagh!&rdquo; laughed Ward, shaking his
whole body by the violence of his convulsions. &ldquo;If
axed to pick out the biggest set of jackasses that ever
got loose, I&rsquo;d hurry up powerful quick and lasso this
crowd. I&rsquo;d have &rsquo;em sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;trust you would not place me in that category,&rdquo;
said Leonidas Swipes, fondly expecting he
would except him on account of his learning and accomplishments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d stand you out alone by yourself, as having
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
more of the jackass in you than all the rest put
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The loud laughter which followed this somewhat
discomfited the Yankee, who, however, made a despairing
effort to recover his lost ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where would you place yourself, if I may
ask, Mr. Lancaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where there was the least danger of seeing <i>you</i>,
but, come, boys, we&rsquo;re losing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the sun was sinking over the western
ridge of the Chevenine Hills, the party drew rein and
slowly approached the Apache Gorge. While yet
some distance, Fred Wainwright had dismounted, and
entering the wood cautiously, made his way to the
dangerous spot, to reconnoitre, and to see that no
ambush threatened. Discovering nothing to excite
alarm, he appeared on a high rock, and waved his
hand as a signal that all was right. A few minutes
later the horses thundered underneath the thick trees
and vegetation that wrapped the hills from peak to
base, and the wearied riders dismounted to rest and
refresh themselves.</p>
<p>All were wearied and dusty, yet the guide said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to stay here; there&rsquo;s a good camping
ground farther in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way for a quarter of a mile in a westerly
direction, where they found a stream of icy cold water
which issued from the mountain side, and an abundance
of rich rank grass. Here their animals were
tethered, and Lancaster told the men that they might
lunch and rest themselves, while he and Fred Wainwright
would return to the Gorge and keep watch for
the Apaches. The cool shadow and the soft grass
were so welcome that the remainder of the party immediately
stretched themselves out upon the ground
to enjoy the luxury of that perfect rest, when it succeeds
perfect exhaustion and weariness.</p>
<p>Reaching the Gorge the two hunters clambered up
among the hills, until they were elevated several hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
feet above the plain and had a view of the surrounding
country for many miles. It was yet very
light, and nothing obstructed their view except the
horizon itself.</p>
<p>When they had reached an available spot, Fred
Wainwright turned his head, looked one moment toward
the north and uttered the thrilling words,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yonder they come!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper squinted his eyes for a moment, looked
long and searchingly, and then replied as cooly as if
he had asked for a chew of tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, that&rsquo;s Charouka and his Apaches,
<i>sartin</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off to the north-east, precisely in the direction indicated
by the guide, a party of a half a dozen horsemen
were seen approaching at a sweeping gallop. To
the ordinary eye they were a half a dozen horsemen
and nothing more; but the keen vision of the trapper
of the Gila saw among them the object of their search.
Florence Brandon held in front of an Apache Indian,
who was no other than the famed Charouka.</p>
<p>The redskins were only a few miles distant, and
would reach the Gorge within half an hour at the
most. As the two surveyed them a moment, the
young hunter suddenly turned to the older one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose Ward they make no halt but pass on
through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it? They won&rsquo;t go far. More likely
they&rsquo;ll stop here and kindle their fires,&rdquo; replied the
guide, rolling his huge tobacco quid from one side of
his cheek to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish to let the others know what is
going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; let them be; they&rsquo;re sound asleep and better
off than here. We can&rsquo;t do any thing until after
dark, when the time for work will be on us. Till
then why we&rsquo;ll just watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Apache party rapidly approached, and as they
neared the Gorge they came down to a walk. By
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
this time they were so near that their features could
be distinguished, and the young hunter looked upon
the pale face of the fair captive with strange emotions.</p>
<p>She was held by the giant Cherouka directly in
front of him. One arm was thrown around her as if
to keep her from falling, while with the other he attended
to himself. Although he grasped her firmly,
yet it was not roughly. It was that grasp with which
we hold the being we are unwilling to give up, and
yet which we love with all the fondness and affection
that our whole nature can summon.</p>
<p>Florence was seated in the usual lady-like fashion,
as if she were supported by the ordinary &ldquo;side-saddle,&rdquo;
her long dress sweeping almost the length of
the horse&rsquo;s body and shrouding her own feet,
and the moccasined limit of the wild Apache from
view. Her long dark hair was streaming over her
shoulders, her face was white and deathly, and there
was a wild agonized look in her dark eyes, which
ought to have moved the hearts of the brutes which
surrounded her, but which, as may well be imagined,
did not affect their sensibilities in the slightest degree.</p>
<p>O how the young hunter longed to raise his rifle as
they came within range and send his bullet through the
brain of the treacherous Apache. But he was too
sensible a fellow to do any such thing, even if he had
forgotten that he was under the orders of his older
companion.</p>
<p>True to the prediction of the latter, they rode a
short distance through the Gorge, and then turning a
little aside, dismounted, and made their preparations
for a night encampment.</p>
<p>Florence was assisted gallantly to the ground, and
allowed to take a seat near a tree, removed a few feet
or so from the others, while they merely glanced at
her as they moved hither and thither, Cherouka, however
scarcely moving his eyes from her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />THE RESCUE.</h2>
<p>The Apaches had scarcely halted, when one of their
number was observed to walk back toward the mouth
of the gorge where he stationed himself. The two
hunters looked at each other and smiled significantly,
while Lancaster gave his younger companion a nudge
in the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does that look, Fred? All right, aint it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there hasn&rsquo;t been a failure to-day in anything
you have said or done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said the trapper with a complacent yawn,
&ldquo;if a feller hunts and traps for thirty years among the
redskins, he ought to know <i>somethin&rsquo;</i> about &rsquo;em, hadn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all about it then; if you had been in my
place, may be you&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve knowed pretty near as much.
But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. Things look good;
now I tell you what must be done, Fred. It&rsquo;s time
the boys were waked up and got ready; I&rsquo;ll go up and
bring them and the animals down where they&rsquo;ll be
handy, and then we&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s to be done, whether
we&rsquo;re to sarcumvent &rsquo;em or to sail in and knock &rsquo;em
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to remain here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here till I come back and we&rsquo;ll arrange
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the next minute the trapper was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Left alone, Fred Wainwright looked cautiously
about him, and then, so far as the gathering darkness
of the imperfect light of the small camp-fire would
permit, saw the position of matters. The Apaches
had kindled a fire, and were cooking a large piece of
meat over it; Florence was seated on the ground
about a dozen feet back of them, not secured or
bound in any manner.</p>
<p>Why need she be? What chance had she of fleeing?
Was there ever a moment when the black eyes of an
Apache were not fixed upon her, and were those of
Cherouka ever removed? No; she was too sensible
of thinking of such a step.</p>
<p>Yet as the keen eyes of the young hunter rested
upon the scene, he saw there was an opportunity
which might never come again. If she could only be
apprised of the proximity of her friends, there was no
reason why she should not give her enemies the slip.
At any rate, he had looked but a few minutes when
he determined to make the attempt.</p>
<p>Good fortune which had favored our friends so far,
caused the encampment to be on the western side of
the gorge, the same as that occupied by the hunters,
and where now Fred Wainwright began creeping
stealthily forward toward the captive.</p>
<p>He was too experienced a hunter to attempt anything
like this, unless there was a good prospect of
success. He was as certain, as any one could be of
the most certain of all things, that when his friends
were gathered together, and made a charge upon the
Indians, they could scatter them like chaff, and retake
Florence Brandon without the danger of a scratch to
her. Consequently nothing like the present would be
attempted, if there was cause for the least fear of precipitating
matters.</p>
<p>Our hero reached a point about twenty feet not in
the rear but at one side of the girl, and then paused to
deliberate upon the best method of apprising her of
his presence. Carefully scrutinizing everything around
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
him, he finally searched on the ground until he found
a small pebble which he tossed so dexterously that it
dropped in her lap. She instantly raised her head
and looked toward the Indians evidently thinking it
came from them. This was the critical moment; and
Fred improved it, by flinging another one as skilfully
as before.</p>
<p>This accomplished its mission. Florence Brandon
knew that a friend was near at hand, and she signified
her understanding of matters by glancing quickly in
the direction from which the pebble came and giving
a quick wave of the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; muttered the hunter, &ldquo;she understands;
she is as bright and keen as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creeping still closer until he had reached a point,
beyond which he dare not pass, he paused to make
sure that his situation would admit his acting as he had
determined to do in case he made an attempt to rescue
the captive. Behind him the wood and shrubbery
were of impenetrable darkness, so that he could
maneuver in them to the best advantage.</p>
<p>Now that he was sure the ear of the girl was strained
to catch the slightest sound, he waited but a moment,
and then whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This way, quick!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her head, glanced fearfully around her,
and then rising to her feet, ran rapidly and lightly
toward the young hunter. She had gone but a dozen
steps or so, when an exclamation of Cherouka showed
that he had discovered the attempt, and he darted
after her. He evidently believed it a despairing
attempt upon her part, done without the connivance of
any one, and he intended to bring her back with the
least trouble to herself and without any outcry or
demonstration, so far as he was able to prevent it.</p>
<p>The other Apaches witnessed the whole thing, but
very probably they concluded if Cherouka intended to
make a wife of the &ldquo;pale face,&rdquo; it was about time he
commenced the &ldquo;breaking in&rdquo; process, and they
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
therefore continued their attention to the roasting
antelope.</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright stood in a crouching position until
Florence Brandon reached him, when he whispered
hurriedly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t stop; we&rsquo;ll take care of you; run on, and I
will attend to this gentleman.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cherouka came straight ahead until he had reached
a point only a few steps behind the girl, and his arm
was outstretched to seize her, when a dark body
suddenly arose to his feet, and the next moment to use
an elegant expression, &ldquo;the first thing he knew he
didn&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; for he was felled senseless by
the crashing blow of Fred Wainwright dealt straight in
his face.</p>
<p>Thus far, thus well. The hunter now whirled on his
heel, and started after the flying girl. She was too
startled to comprehend that it was a friend instead of
an enemy who was pursuing her, and she fled all the
faster. Not until they had run quite a distance, and
he had called to her several times in as loud a tone as
he deemed prudent, did she pause and wait for him to
come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! is that you, Mr. Wainwright?&rdquo; she asked
trembling like an affrighted bird, hardly daring to trust
her senses, and ready to dart away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there is no need of this hurry, Miss Brandon;
they don&rsquo;t suspect you have had help and we can
take matters more leisurely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Cherouka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will trouble you very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t killed him?&rdquo; she asked, her heart
recoiling at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he merely ran against my fist; he will be alive
and kicking and howling in a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! let us hurry then, for I would rather die
than let him get me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, except there are ten of our men waiting for
us a short distance from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how thankful I am; let us hasten to them
before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please take my arm; and we may be able to travel
faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did so, and they walked forward as fast as the
nature of the ground would permit.</p>
<p>As yet there was no outcry or clamor from the
Apache camp, proof that the real flight of the girl had
not been discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther away are our friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a short distance; we will meet them in a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think they cannot get us&mdash;the Indians
will not follow and kill you and take me back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may pursue us; but as to getting you into
their hands again, that is a far different matter, and
one about which there will be a little fun if they
attempt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I cannot realize that I am safe again; and you
have followed us all the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly; Lancaster the guide, knew they were
making for this point, and so we hurried and got
here ahead of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see us come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we or rather I have had my eyes on
you for the last hour or more, but we waited until it
was dark&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swan if I didn&rsquo;t run my chin over a limb that
time, and it nearly sawed my neck off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your mouth shet or you&rsquo;ll spile the whole
game. Hello! there&rsquo;s somebody here. That you,
Wainwright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I am here, Ward, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! you&rsquo;re a trump&mdash;hello!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>At this instant, a succession of yells was heard from
the direction of the Apache camp, proclaiming that
Cherouka had come to his senses, and the redskins
were at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em yell,&rdquo; muttered the guide, as he noticed
some trepidation among those around him, &ldquo;what can
they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may get torches&mdash;that is, as it were,&mdash;and
follow us,&rdquo; ventured Mr. Swipes, &ldquo;but, Miss
Brandon, allow me to congratulate you on your
successful escape from the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; let&rsquo;s hear how it was,&rdquo; said several as the
two young persons appeared among the overjoyed
whites, who gathered around them and shook their
hands again and again.</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright related in a few brief words, how
he had seen there was a good chance to get her away
from the Indians without waiting for the return of his
friend. At its conclusion the latter said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you saved us a fight any way; and I s&rsquo;pose
that suits the gal better. Let&rsquo;s mount and be off.
Fred, we&rsquo;ve only &rsquo;leven animals and there be &rsquo;leven of
us. I&rsquo;m mighty afraid you&rsquo;ll have to take the gal on
your hoss with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was nothing very dreadful, and the young
people managed to survive it. Strange emotions
thrilled the heart of Fred Wainwright, as he held the
dear being close to him, and several times he was on
the point of giving utterance to the tumultuous feelings
which thronged upward,&mdash;but he restrained himself.
The time had not yet come.</p>
<p>All night long they traveled their progress being
necessarily slow. Nothing more was heard of their
pursuers, and at daylight they halted on the ridge not
more than half their distance accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ascend to the top of the ridge and take
observations. I swan if I feel quite safe!&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Swipes as he clambered to the top. Reaching the
backbone of the ridge, he took a careful survey of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
opposite plain which stretched far away to the South
and South-West.</p>
<p>The next moment a loud shout was heard from the
Yankee, and he was seen dancing and flinging his
arms like a lunatic. All eyes were turned wonderingly
toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p>Leonidas Swipes continued dancing, shouting and
gesticulating like a madman. He threw his hat in air,
and, as it came down stamped upon it, turned summerset,
hooted like an Indian, and finally shouted to
the upturned faces below him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jingo! just come up here! Did you ever see
such a sight! Ki &rsquo;yi!&rdquo; and he executed another
double shuffle as a vent to his superabundant glee.</p>
<p>Fred Wainwright finally accepted the invitation and
clambered up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look off there!&rdquo; shouted the Yankee, before
the man has fairly reached him, &ldquo;aint that enough to
make your eyes sparkle? I swan! Ki &rsquo;yi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment, the young hunter saw that the
fellow had good cause for his unusual excitement; for
there, right below him, were resting the five thousand
and odd sheep, which the Comanches had taken so
unceremoniously from him a few days before. Their
multitudinous <i>baaing</i>, made it a source of wonder that
their proximity had not been suspected ere this.</p>
<p>It was yet early in the morning, and the sheep were
resting from the severe marching to which they had
been subjected. The Indians could be seen, scattered
here and there on the outer confines of the immense
drove, where any stampede would be sure instantly to
arouse them. Here they were slumbering, their faithful
animals cropping the grass close beside them,
where they could be reached in a second&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>One Comanche had just risen, and stood leaning
against his horse, and appeared to be yawning and
gaping. As there was imminent danger of Swipes
being seen, Fred pushed him down from his perch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;You want to alarm them, do you, and have them
all get away, not that you have a chance to recover
your property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I swan it makes a feller feel so good that it
don&rsquo;t make much difference whether I get &rsquo;em back
agin or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little good will it do you, then. Let&rsquo;s go down
again and have consultations with Ward, and decide
upon our means of recapturing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t they give us the slip while we&rsquo;re talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll stay here and watch while you go
down and make the arrangements. Be as quick as
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along; you&rsquo;ll get to dancing and hooting
again and alarm the whole country, so don&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospect of recapturing the entire herd of sheep
was too tempting to pass by. When a man sees an
opportunity of recovering a fortune lost, is he apt to
shut his eyes and turn his back upon it? Not much.</p>
<p>The arrangements were soon made. Ward Lancaster,
Fred Wainwright and four of the best mounted
men dismounted and led their horses up the ridge,
and as carefully descended on the opposite side. Here
they remounted, consulted a few moments, and then
with a series of resounding whoops, dashed around
the southern side of the drove, firing their guns at the
Comanches at the same time.</p>
<p>The latter comprehending that the game was up,
vaulted upon their mustangs and sped away like an
arrow over the prairie, firing as they rode. In a few
minutes, the entire body of sheep was in motion to the
northward. They kept along the western side of the
ridge, while Florence Brandon and her friends followed
the eastern slope, both parties instantly remaining
within call of each other.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the same day, the entire company
united with the emigrant train and the march
westward was resumed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Messrs. Swipes, Bircham and Doolittle with the occasional
assistance of the others kept the sheep drove
in motion losing a very slight per cent. When the
point was reached where they were to divide, they
met a party from Sacramento who were going east
to purchase sheep and cattle. They had an abundance
of funds, and, after considerable bantering, they took
the entire flock off of Swipe&rsquo;s hands, giving him thirty
thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The Yankee divided the money as he had agreed,
with his companions, and compelled Lancaster and
several others to take quite a handsome present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said he, as the three set their faces toward
San Francisco, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going hum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the Fort Mifflin Institute for the
Education of the Youths of both Sexes?&rdquo; inquired
Fred Wainwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort Mifflin Institute be hanged. I&rsquo;m going hum
to buy Deacon Popkin&rsquo;s farm and settle down with
Araminta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And home he went.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day in spring time some years
ago, and the emigrant train was proceeding leisurely
through Southern California. It was within a few
days of its destination. A few hundred yards in the
rear of the company, a lady and gentleman were riding,
their horses walking closely together, while the
riders conversed in those slow sweet tones, so unceremoniously
by persons under such circumstances.
They were our old acquaintances, Fred Wainwright
and Florence Brandon. There was a peculiar smile
on the face of the latter, as she said, after a moment&rsquo;s
lull in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Mr. Fred Wainwright, that I do
not know who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked inquiringly at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Mr. Frederick Ashland, of Missouri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence! Florence, who has betrayed me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, but yourself, on the night you so nobly
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
rescued me from the Apaches. I penetrated your disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let me know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would wait and see your object in thus
remaining <span class="sc">INCOGNITO</span>; but I can&rsquo;t divine your meaning,
as I thought I would let you know that I generally
keep my eyes shut. Mr. Frederick Ashland,
what is the cause of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know after we were engaged, I called several
times to see you, and was told you were out. I
felt hurt very much at this, as I knew it was untrue.
Finally, when I concluded to go to California, I made
up my mind I would call and bid you good bye, your
aunt, Miss Sillingsby told me you positively refused to
see me, and I received a note which I had sent unopened.
This was the last drop in the bucket and I
left you, resolved never to look on you again, and I
should never have done so until we were so strangely
brought together, and I believed you did not suspect
my identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Florence told how she had been deceived;
that Miss Sillingsby had taken a fancy to a
rich old crusty bachelor, and resolved that Florence
should marry him. She had started the false message
between the two, and finally succeeded in making both
believe that the other had committed the transgression,
and hopelessly estranged them.</p>
<p>But now all was made right&mdash;and well, we have nothing
more to say. Our readers can fill in the minor
details of a little scene at Fort Mifflin a few months
later, when Miss Sillingsby had the chagrin and the
others the exquisite pleasure of seeing our hero and
heroine made happy in each other&rsquo;s love.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
